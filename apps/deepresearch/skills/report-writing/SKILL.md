# Report Writing Guide

## Report Structure

### 1. Title
- Descriptive and specific
- Include the scope or time frame if relevant
- Example: "Advances in Protein Folding Since AlphaFold 3 (2024-2025)"

### 2. Executive Summary
- 2-3 paragraphs summarizing key findings
- Written last, after the full report is complete
- Should stand alone — a reader should understand the main conclusions

### 3. Body Sections
- Organize logically (chronological, thematic, or comparative)
- Each section should address one sub-topic
- Use inline citations [1][2] for every factual claim
- Include data, statistics, and direct quotes where appropriate

### 4. Conclusions
- Synthesize findings across all sections
- Highlight key takeaways and implications
- Note limitations of the research
- Suggest areas for further investigation

### 5. References
- Number references in order of first appearance
- Format: `[N] Author/Organization, "Title", URL, Accessed: YYYY-MM-DD`

## Writing Style

### Clarity
- Use clear, direct language
- Define technical terms on first use
- Prefer active voice over passive
- Keep paragraphs focused on one idea

### Objectivity
- Present evidence before conclusions
- Acknowledge counter-arguments
- Use hedging language for uncertain claims ("suggests", "indicates", "appears to")
- Distinguish between facts and interpretation

### Citation Practices
- Cite every factual claim, statistic, and quote
- Use inline citations [N] immediately after the claim
- Multiple citations for well-supported claims: [1][3][7]
- Never present information without attribution

## Formatting Tips

- Use headers (##, ###) to create clear hierarchy
- Use bullet points for lists of findings
- Use tables for comparative data
- Use blockquotes for direct quotes from sources
- Bold key terms and important findings
