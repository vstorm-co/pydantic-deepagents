AlphaFold is a neural network-based model that predicts protein structures with atomic accuracy without requiring nearly as much computational power as physics-based models. To do that, the algorithm first searches genetic databases for similar protein sequences and creates a multiple-sequence alignment. Then, it generates a pairwise representation to encode spatial relationships between amino acids. The refined pairwise information is passed through a transformer network to produce a final prediction of the protein's structure. [...] This AI tool has revolutionized biology, enabling the design of new proteins for medicine, energy, and sustainability. Since 2020, AlphaFold has been used to predict the structures of millions of proteins, making waves across the scientific community. (As of the writing of this article, the Nature paper describing AlphaFold has been cited 32998 times). The latest AlphaFold 3 model is freely available for non-commercial research use, democratizing protein engineering\u2014something we could not have even imagined a decade ago.\n\n#### Beyond AlphaFold [...] The majority of the initial models, such as Rosetta developed in 2024 Nobel Laurate David Baker\u2019s lab at the University of Washington, were physics-based. While these models could accurately describe the thermodynamic forces driving protein folding, they lacked the computational power to brute-force 10300 possible configurations. The development of deep learning algorithms in the early 2010s was a breakthrough moment for protein structure prediction. In 2018, a team from DeepMind, the UK artificial intelligence lab bought by Google in 2014, entered into the thirteenth CASP competition with a model called AlphaFold and placed first. By the next competition in 2020, AlphaFold 2, a revamped algorithm from DeepMind, left all other models in the dust.\n\nTitle: Beyond AlphaFold 2: The next frontier in macromolecular structure ...\nURL: https://www.mindwalkai.com/blog/beyond-alphafold-2\nContent: In addition to proteins, AlphaFold 3 introduces capabilities for predicting the structures of nucleic acids (such as RNA) and small molecules. This expanded versatility makes it a powerful tool for drug discovery, as it can model the interactions between proteins and ligands. These substantial improvements are critical advancements for biotherapeutic development, where understanding these interactions is essential for developing targeted therapies like monoclonal antibodies and, in the broader sense, developing in silico screening strategies. [...] ## AlphaFold 3: Expanding the horizons of structural biology\n\nIn May 2024, DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs (a subsidiary of Alphabet founded by Demis Hassabis) released AlphaFold 3, with a closed-source web server accessible to academic researchers. At the protein structure prediction, AlphaFold 3 is an improvement over AlphaFold 2: it is better at predicting monomeric and multimeric structures , specifically in the field of antibody-antigen complex modeling where AlphaFold 2 was notoriously lacking . [...] Callaway, E. (2024). Who will make AlphaFold3 open source? Scientists race to crack AI model. Nature, 630(8015), 14-15.\n\n Callaway, E. (2022).

Some of AlphaFold 3\u2019s advancements, notably its improved performance predictions of antigen-antibody complexes, are directly related to its reduced dependence on the MSA signal. Nevertheless, for protein structure prediction, AlphaFold 3 still makes heavy use of co-evolutionary data from the MSA.\n\nCrucially, AlphaFold 3 predicts the coordinates of individual atoms within a complex. This is distinct from AlphaFold 2, which predicted the positions of amino acid residues and their side chains. The new approach gives AlphaFold 3 the computational flexibility to tackle different types of molecules.\n\n### Tokenisation [...] ### Diffusion\n\nAlphaFold 3 predicts raw atom coordinates using a diffusion module, making it a \u201cgenerative\u201d ML model. Generative models create new data similar to the examples they learn from: in the case of AlphaFold 3, structures from the Protein Data Bank. This contrasts with non-generative models like AlphaFold 2, which identify patterns in the existing data. [...] Many practical details remain the same, notably the use of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) as the main input of the neural network. Furthermore, the overall architecture of AlphaFold 3 retains a familiar structure, that of AlphaFold 2, where a large trunk processes a pairwise representation of the chemical complex, which is then used by a structure module to generate explicit atomic positions.\n\nHowever, despite these foundational similarities, AlphaFold 3\u2019s architecture has substantially improved over AlphaFold 2. The new architecture accommodates more general chemical structures and improves the data efficiency of learning.\n\nTitle: AlphaFold \u2014 Google DeepMind\nURL: https://deepmind.google/science/alphafold/\nContent: Made from long chains of amino acids, each has a unique complex 3D structure. But figuring out just one of these can take several years, and hundreds of thousands of dollars. In 2020, AlphaFold solved this problem, with the ability to predict protein structures in minutes, to a remarkable degree of accuracy.\n\nThat\u2019s helping researchers understand what individual proteins do and how they interact with other molecules. So valuable time and resources can be redirected into advancing research that could help solve society\u2019s biggest medical and environmental challenges.\n\n### Timeline of a breakthrough\n\n#### In November 2020, AlphaFold was recognised as a solution to the 50-year \u201cprotein-folding problem\u201d.\n\n### AlphaGo\u2019s success proves AI\u2019s readiness to tackle protein folding [...] ### Understanding the faulty proteins linked to cancer and autism\n\n### Creating plastic-eating enzymes that could save us from pollution\n\n### Advancing discovery of better drugs and medicine\n\n### The race to cure a billion people from a deadly parasitic disease\n\n### Accelerating the race against antibiotic resistance\n\n### AlphaFold unlocks one of the greatest puzzles in biology\n\nAlphaFold has allowed us to take our project to the next level, from a fundamental science stage to the preclinical and clinical development stage.\n\n## Powered by AlphaFold 3 \u2014 AlphaFold Server predicts how proteins will interact with other molecules throughout cells.\n\n### Try AlphaFold\n\n#### A powerful suite of tools, helping the scientific community advance research.\n\n### AlphaFold Protein Structure Database [...] ## AlphaFold Server\n\nPowered by AlphaFold 3 \u2014 AlphaFold Server predicts how proteins will interact with other molecules throughout cells.\n\n## AlphaFold Protein Structure Database\n\nView over 200 million protein structure predictions to support your research.\n\n## AlphaFold 3\n\nAccess the AlphaFold 3 model code and weights for academic use.\n\nAlphaFold has revealed millions of intricate 3D protein structures, and is helping scientists understand how life\u2019s molecules interact.\n\n### What is AlphaFold?\n\n#### Proteins underpin every biological process, in every living thing.\n\nTitle: AlphaFold\u2014for predicting protein structures\nURL: https://laskerfoundation.org/winners/alphafold-a-technology-for-predicting-protein-structures/\nContent: Since AlphaFold\u2019s release, we have been thrilled by what the scientific community has done with it. To date it has been used by over a million researchers to advance a huge and diverse range of work, everything from enzyme design to disease understanding to drug discovery. The speed with which AlphaFold has been adopted by the biological community as a standard research tool has been very gratifying to see \u2013 it is everything we hoped for and more, and hopefully just the beginning of the impact it will make. [...] When we founded DeepMind in 2010, our goal was to use artificial intelligence to advance knowledge and accelerate scientific discovery. The watershed moment came in 2016 when our prior system, AlphaGo, became the first AI program to beat a world champion at the complex and ancient game of Go. I knew then we had the general AI knowhow and ideas to tackle as formidable a challenge as protein folding and the AlphaFold project was born. [...] It took many further years of development and innovation specific to the problem of course. AlphaFold proved to be the most difficult and complex AI system we had ever built, but when we received the results for the CASP13 competition in 2020 we knew we had achieved atomic accuracy on the target protein structures, an amazing moment that none of us on the team will ever forget.\n\nTitle: The Protein Folding Problem: The day AI unlocked a secret of life\nURL: https://medicine.iu.edu/blogs/research-updates/the-protein-folding-problem-the-day-ai-unlocked-a-secret-of-life\nContent: Comparing its performance to the top team from four years earlier illustrates the progress made. While Baker's team scored a maximum of around 80 points in 2014, AlphaFold achieved an accuracy close to 120 points in 2018. This signifies a substantial leap in the field of protein structure prediction.  \n  \nHow could AlphaFold achieve such remarkable results? Everyone at the competition waited for the AlphaFold team to reveal their experimental model, and the AlphaFold team explained their approach this way (Senior et al., 2020).\n\nFigure 7 [...] 3.

[...] So, how did AlphaFold2 manage to not only outperform all previous attempts by a wide margin but also significantly surpass its predecessor, AlphaFold1? This can be viewed from two perspectives (Jumper et al., 2021).\n\nTitle: AlphaFold Changed Science. After 5 Years, It's Still Evolving | WIRED\nURL: https://www.wired.com/story/alphafold-changed-science-after-5-years-its-still-evolving/\nContent: Its work culminated in the compilation of a database that now contains over 200 million predicted structures, essentially the entire known protein universe, and is used by nearly 3.5 million researchers in 190 countries around the world. The Nature article published in 2021 describing the algorithm has been cited 40,000 times to date. Last year, AlphaFold 3 arrived, extending the capabilities of artificial intelligence to DNA, RNA, and drugs. That transition is not without challenges\u2014such as \u201cstructural hallucinations\u201d in the disordered regions of proteins\u2014but it marks a step toward the future.\n\nTo understand what the next five years holds for AlphaFold, WIRED spoke with Pushmeet Kohli, vice president of research at DeepMind and architect of its AI \u200b\u200bfor Science division. [...] We focus on what I call \u201croot node problems,\u201d areas where the scientific community agrees solutions would be transformative, but where conventional approaches won't get us there in the next five to 10 years. Think of it like a tree of knowledge\u2014if you solve these root problems, you unlock entire new branches of research. Protein folding was definitely one of those.\n\nLooking ahead, I see three key areas of opportunity: building more powerful models that can truly reason and collaborate with scientists like a research partner, getting these tools into the hands of every scientist on the planet, and tackling even bolder ambitions, like creating the first accurate simulation of a complete human cell. [...] # AlphaFold Changed Science. After 5 Years, It\u2019s Still Evolving\n\nalphafold\n\nAlphaFold, the artificial intelligence system developed by Google DeepMind, has just turned five. Over the past few years, we've periodically reported on its successes; last year, it won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n\nUntil AlphaFold's debut in November 2020, DeepMind had been best known for teaching an artificial intelligence to beat human champions at the ancient game of Go. Then it started playing something more serious, aiming its deep learning algorithms at one of the most difficult problems in modern science: protein folding. The result was AlphaFold2, a system capable of predicting the three-dimensional shape of proteins with atomic accuracy.\n\nTitle: The Isomorphic Labs Drug Design Engine unlocks a new frontier ...\nURL: https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/articles/the-isomorphic-labs-drug-design-engine-unlocks-a-new-frontier\nContent: Since our release of AlphaFold 3 in 2024 together with Google DeepMind, the field of AI drug discovery has moved at an extraordinary pace. Whilst AlphaFold 3 delivered a dramatic leap in performance from previous generations of structure prediction models, a key challenge remained: understanding biomolecular structures alone was not sufficient for unlocking real-world drug discovery programs in silico (on a computer). [...] ## Structure Prediction of Truly Novel Systems\n\nAccurately predicting the structure of biomolecules and how they interact remains a crucial capability for rational drug design. Many critical downstream tasks are unlocked by being able to accurately model the small nuances in a protein\u2019s geometry - whether understanding the impact of disease-causing mutations, or predicting which molecules will bind to a target protein.\n\nAlphaFold 3 transformed protein-ligand structure prediction at the time of its release and the freely available AlphaFold Protein Database accelerated science on a scale that was previously unimaginable. To date, it has been used by over 3 million researchers in more than 190 countries.\n\nTitle: AlphaFold: Five Years of Impact - Google DeepMind\nURL: https://deepmind.google/blog/alphafold-five-years-of-impact/\nContent: A set of five vertical, stylized graphic panels, each showing abstract, colorful renderings of protein or molecular structures with helical and ribbon elements, representing the impact of AlphaFold.\n\nSince 2020, AlphaFold has accelerated the pace of science and fueled a global wave of biological discovery \u2014 an achievement recognized with a Nobel Prize\n\nFive years ago, AlphaFold 2 solved the protein structure prediction problem, unlocking new avenues of biological research and providing our first major proof point that AI can be a powerful tool to advance science. [...] ## A global engine for discovery\n\nIn 2021, we launched the AlphaFold Protein Database in partnership with EMBL-EBI, which was a tipping point toward AlphaFold becoming a scientific tool adopted around the world. And one year later, we released AlphaFold 2\u2019s predictions for more than 200 million protein structures, achieving what would take hundreds of millions of years to solve experimentally.\n\nThe freely available AlphaFold Protein Database has accelerated science on a scale that was previously unimaginable. It has been used by over 3 million researchers in more than 190 countries, including over 1 million users in low- and middle-income countries. Over 30% of AlphaFold-related research is focused on better understanding disease, benefiting human welfare. [...] The model is designed to predict the structure and interactions of all of life's molecules \u2014 not just proteins, but DNA, RNA, and ligands (the small molecules that make up most drugs). It can also generate the joint 3D structures of entire molecular complexes, allowing a holistic view of how a potential drug molecule binds to its target protein, or how proteins interact with genetic material.\n\nThe AlphaFold Server is empowering non-commercial researchers globally to harness this technology, accelerating their ability to formulate and test new hypotheses. So far, it\u2019s helped make more than 8 million folds - predictions of structures and interactions - for thousands of researchers around the world.", "_ts": "2026-02-16T21:47:12.563212+00:00"}

These tools have revolutionized structural biology with their highly accurate predictions, driving progress in protein modeling, drug discovery, and the study of protein dynamics. Its exceptional accuracy has redefined our understanding of protein folding, which enables groundbreaking advancements in protein design, disease research and discusses future integration with experimental techniques. In addition, their achievement features, architectures, important case studies, and noteworthy effects in the field of biology and medicine were evaluated. In consideration of the fact that AF2 is a relatively recent innovation, it has already been taken into account in many studies that highlight its applications in many ways. Moreover, the limitations of AF2 that directed to the introduction of AF3 are also reported, which is a great improvement as it provides precise predictions of the structures and interactions of proteins, DNA, RNA, and ligands, thereby aiding in the understanding of the molecular level. Addressing current challenges and forecasting future developments, this work underscores the lasting significance of AF in reshaping the scientific landscape of protein research.\n\n**Keywords:**  AlphaFold2; AlphaFold3; Artificial intelligence; DeepMind; Protein structure prediction.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

Nature\u2019s versatile biological machines, proteins, are composed of strings of amino acids that fold into complex, dynamic shapes\u2014like origami. The function of the protein is determined by its structure, which, in turn, depends on the amino acid sequence.\n\nThe vision of engineering custom proteins with specified properties and functions by designing a specific amino acid sequence has captivated scientists for a long time. The problem is that protein sequence space is practically immeasurable, and trying to engineer a protein to perform a specific function is a Sisyphean task. For decades, protein engineers evolved functions\u2014such as an enzyme\u2019s thermostability or substrate affinity\u2014in the lab using a method called directed evolution. Alternatively, they would attempt to rationally design the desired functions by looking at the protein structure (a 3D model obtained through X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy) and trying to figure out which protein regions they needed to change, followed by making hundreds of different mutated variants and testing them in the lab.\n\nAs artificial intelligence continues to transform protein engineering, thought leaders and startup pioneers alike will converge at this year\u2019s [SynBioBeta: The Global Synthetic Biology Conference](https://www.synbiobeta.com/events/synbiobeta-2025) to discuss the latest breakthroughs in generative models for protein design. Presenters will highlight how these computational tools are fast becoming an essential driver of innovation across the synthetic biology landscape.\n\n#### The AlphaFold Revolution\n\nGiven the arduous and inefficient nature of engineering proteins in the lab, the field was long overdue for a computational makeover. However, until about 2018, the computational power required to solve a protein structure was considered unattainable. Back in 1969, molecular biologist Cyrus Levinthal estimated that it would take longer than the age of the known universe to solve the protein folding problem since a typical-length protein can fold into 10300 possible configurations. But that doesn\u2019t mean no one has tried it.\n\nSince the late 1980s, scientists developed molecular physics-based models to try to figure out the rules of protein folding. To compare how well the different models worked, researchers established the [Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction](https://predictioncenter.org/) (CASP) challenge, a protein structure prediction competition that began in 1994. In the course of the competition, teams would attempt to solve the structure of a protein based on their models and then compare those predictions with experimentally determined structures.\n\nThe majority of the initial models, such as [Rosetta](https://rosettacommons.org/software/) developed in 2024 Nobel Laurate [David Baker\u2019s lab](https://www.bakerlab.org/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), were physics-based. While these models could accurately describe the thermodynamic forces driving protein folding, they lacked the computational power to brute-force 10300 possible configurations. The development of deep learning algorithms in the early 2010s was a breakthrough moment for protein structure prediction. In 2018, a team from [DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/), the UK artificial intelligence lab bought by Google in 2014, entered into the thirteenth CASP competition with a model called AlphaFold and [placed first](https://www.forbes.com/sites/samshead/2018/12/03/deepmind-starts-to-show-how-ai-can-be-used-to-solve-scientific-problems/). By the next competition in 2020, AlphaFold 2, a revamped algorithm from DeepMind, left all other models in the dust.\n\nAlphaFold, which won the [2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/press-release/) for its researchers, was a true breakthrough in protein folding prediction. AlphaFold is a neural network-based model that predicts protein structures with atomic accuracy without requiring nearly as much computational power as physics-based models. To do that, the algorithm first searches genetic databases for similar protein sequences and creates a multiple-sequence alignment. Then, it generates a pairwise representation to encode spatial relationships between amino acids. The refined pairwise information is passed through a transformer network to produce a final prediction of the protein's structure.\n\nThis AI tool has revolutionized biology, enabling the design of new proteins for medicine, energy, and sustainability. Since 2020, AlphaFold has been used to predict the structures of millions of proteins, making waves across the scientific community. (As of the writing of this article, the [Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2) describing AlphaFold has been cited 32998 times). The latest AlphaFold 3 model is [freely available](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-deepmind-isomorphic-alphafold-3-ai-model/) for non-commercial research use, democratizing protein engineering\u2014something we could not have even imagined a decade ago.\n\n#### Beyond AlphaFold\n\nSince the breakthrough of AlphaFold, other AI models have been developed by academic labs and biotech companies, including\u00a0 [EvoBind](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.23.501214v1), [ESMFold](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade2574), and [RFDiffusion](https://www.bakerlab.org/2023/07/11/diffusion-model-for-protein-design/), which can predict protein structure and function, as well as elucidate the folding of other molecule types (DNA and RNA) and model complex molecular interactions between proteins and their ligands.\n\n[RFdiffusion](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06415-8) is a model built on an open-source algorithm called [RoseTTAFold](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj8754), developed by David Baker\u2019s lab. It generates new protein structures in a manner similar to how DALL-E or Midjourney generate art. This tool was able to solve new design challenges, including molecular binding and oligomer design. Both RoseTTAFold and RFdiffusion have since then been upgraded to [All-Atom](https://www.ipd.uw.edu/2023/10/introducing-rosettafold-and-rfdiffusion-all-atom/) versions, which enable modeling of not just proteins but biological complexes made from different molecules, including DNA, RNA, small molecules, metals, and other bonded atoms.\n\nAs large language models like ChatGPT took the world by storm, scientists realized that you can use them for proteins as well\u2014and this has turned out to be a very successful strategy. These gigantic models trained on extensive volumes of data enable scientists to generate de novo designs based not on protein structure but function. Dubbed [protein language models](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-86519-5) (PLMs), these tools are a lot more accessible for researchers because tuning a natural language model is much easier than developing conventional machine learning algorithms.\n\nThe progress in generative AI for protein design is by no means finished. Researchers are still working to refine the algorithms to create better proteins for specific applications, as well as expand the capabilities of what is possible for biology in the age of AI. Last month, NVIDIA released [GenMol](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/evaluating-genmol-as-a-generalist-foundation-model-for-molecular-generation/), a foundational model for molecular generation. GenMol offers a versatile molecular generative framework based on discrete diffusion and non-autoregressive decoding designed to streamline drug discovery from molecule design to lead optimization.\n\n#### Generative Design in Synthetic Biology\n\nSo, what does this mean for synthetic biology and the bioeconomy?\n\nThe dream of being able to design custom proteins has finally come true. For example, we can make new enzymes that are stable at high temperatures. Using enzymes that do not degrade in high-temperature industrial processes (such as making paper from wood pulp) translates into millions of dollars in savings. AI is also revolutionizing drug discovery research by allowing scientists to model how proteins and small-molecule drugs interact with their targets. Additionally, we can engineer proteins that have no equivalents in nature\u2014which could help us solve the challenges of the twenty-first century.\n\nCompanies such as [Cradle](https://www.cradle.bio/) have been using protein language models to design better [enzymes](https://www.cradle.bio/blog/case-study-combining-ai-generated-mutations-with-human-expertise-for-better-enzyme-designs), [receptor-binding proteins](https://www.cradle.bio/blog/adaptyv-protein-design-competition), and [antibodies](https://www.cradle.bio/blog/antibody-ngs-data-initiative), with applications across the entire biotechnology spectrum, from industrial and food biotech to biopharma. [Absci](https://www.absci.com/) is transforming the biologics discovery pipeline by enabling [de novo](https://www.synbiobeta.com/read/absci-and-amd-team-up-to-revolutionize-drug-discovery-with-ai) antibody design. And [Ginkgo\u2019s](https://www.ginkgo.bio/) models have been able to improve [PETase activity](https://foundrytheory.substack.com/p/the-petase-mask-fill-challenge), an enzyme capable of degrading plastic.\n\nAs the recent [Advanced Biotech for Sustainability (AB4S](https://www.ab4s.org/report)) [report](https://www.ab4s.org/report) highlights, advanced biotechnology could reduce global emissions by 5% and generate $1 trillion in economic value across the food, agriculture, chemicals, personal care, and transportation fuels sectors. With generative AI becoming a mainstay in biotechnology, transforming the world through synthetic biology is no longer a pipe dream\u2014it is just a work in progress.\n\n###### Read More\n\n[View All](../read)\n\nAaron Blotnick\n\nFeb 11, 2026\n\n###### [Burn, Baby, Burn: EPA Moves to Dismantle the Legal Backbone of U.S. Climate Policy](./burn-baby-burn-epa-moves-to-dismantle-the-legal-backbone-of-u.s.-climate-policy)\n\nAaron Blotnick\n\nFeb 11, 2026\n\n###### [Burn, Baby, Burn: EPA Moves to Dismantle the Legal Backbone of U.S. Climate Policy](./burn-baby-burn-epa-moves-to-dismantle-the-legal-backbone-of-u.s.-climate-policy)\n\n[Longevity](../)\n\nAaron Blotnick\n\nFeb 10, 2026\n\n###### [J.

frontier in macromolecular structure prediction\n\n13:26\n\nRead time 9 min\n\n## **Introduction**\n\nAs a testament to the recent breakthrough of deep-learning technologies in the field of (structural) bioinformatics, half of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2024 [[1](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/press-release/)] has been awarded to John Jumper and Demis Hassabis, the main contributors to AlphaFold 2, the other half to Prof. David Baker (University of Washington, Seattle). Speaking about breakthroughs is not an understatement: as of this time of writing, the original AlphaFold2 publication [2] has been cited more than 27,800 times (according to Google Scholar [[3](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=6286436358625670901)]). For comparison, on Feb 21, 2023 (roughly 1.5 years ago), the number of citations was just 8,783. AlphaFold 2 is a solution to the protein folding problem and can predict with near experimental accuracy the structure of proteins as long as their primary structures (the sequence of amino acids along the protein chain) are known. This technology has been integrated with the LensAI\u2071\u2122 *in silico* discovery platform, and we have discussed it in length in different blog posts since the public release of AlphaFold2 [[4](https://blog.biostrand.ai/explained-a-brief-look-into-alphafold-2), [5](https://blog.biostrand.ai/explained-how-to-plot-the-prediction-quality-metrics-with-alphafold2), [6](https://blog.biostrand.ai/scaling-up-structural-biology-with-alphafold2)]. In this new blog post, we will review how these latest developments are impacting drug discovery, what can be technically achieved with current technology, and assess limitations that hinder discovery processes and future outcomes. Finally, we will briefly present how these breakthrough technologies are integrated within the MindWalk LensAI\u00a0platform.\n\n## **AlphaFold 3: Expanding the horizons of structural biology**\n\nIn May 2024, DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs (a subsidiary of Alphabet founded by Demis Hassabis) released AlphaFold 3, with a closed-source web server accessible to academic researchers. At the protein structure prediction, AlphaFold 3 is an improvement over AlphaFold 2: it is better at predicting monomeric and multimeric structures [7], specifically in the field of antibody-antigen complex modeling where AlphaFold 2 was notoriously lacking [8].\n\nIn addition to proteins, AlphaFold 3 introduces capabilities for predicting the structures of nucleic acids (such as RNA) and small molecules. This expanded versatility makes it a powerful tool for drug discovery, as it can model the interactions between proteins and ligands. These substantial improvements are critical advancements for biotherapeutic development, where understanding these interactions is essential for developing targeted therapies like monoclonal antibodies and, in the broader sense, developing *in silico* screening strategies.\n\nWhile the authors' study in the original publication shows beyond state-of-the-art performance for many tasks, third-party benchmarks are still missing for AlphaFold 3, partly due to the limited capacity of the web server and its initial closed-source nature. As announced earlier in the year [[13](https://x.com/pushmeet/status/1790086453520691657)], the source code was released in November 2024, although with a restricted license; thus AlphaFold 3 is less susceptible to tweaking, in-depth analysis, and integration to protein design pipelines compared to AlphaFold 2 [[6](https://blog.biostrand.ai/scaling-up-structural-biology-with-alphafold2)].\n\nIn addition to the base AlphaFold 3 code, several third-party initiatives have taken the initiative to reproduce the architecture of the model, as it was done for AlphaFold 2 before its release [[3](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=6286436358625670901)], and many AlphaFold 3-like prediction pipelines have been released, such as Boltz-1 or Chai-1.\n\nAlphaFold 3 success rate on different benchmark sets, for (from the left to the right) ligand docking, nucleic acids, covalent modifications and protein predictions; and compared to state-of-the-art methods. Adapted from Ref. 7.\n\nSo far, the substantial improvements of AlphaFold 3 outbalance its known limitations: for instance, the algorithm struggles with molecule chirality. Atomic clashes also occur, specifically for large proteins, so molecules can partially overlap, which is physically impossible. As success rates for some tasks remain low, \u201challucinations\u201d may happen. Finally, predictions remain static in nature and completely ignore any dynamical aspect of molecular interaction. These limitations are, of course, not specific to AlphaFold 3, and there are many ways to mitigate these shortcomings by integrating structure prediction within a broader framework for molecular modeling. For instance, models generated by AlphaFold can be used in Molecular Dynamics simulations to assess conformational dynamics, interaction energies between molecular partners, and much more.\n\n## **Structure prediction in practice**\n\nDespite their fame, the practical use of structure prediction tools such as AlphaFold is not often well understood. These tools works within the paradigm that for a given input of sequential molecular data (sequence of amino acids for protein, nucleic acids, \u2026), there is a \u201cstatic\u201d 3D structure (atomic position) which can be predicted solely from this data, representative on the interaction between all involved atoms. While this picture is simplistic and ignores the dynamical nature of macromolecular interactions, which is only partially captured by static representations.\n\nWithin this paradigm, ideally, one would expect that a given input yields a single prediction. Yet, this is not the case. For AlphaFold 2 monomers, there are 5 trained model weights which outputs 5 predictions for a single inputs. These predictions are scored and ranked by the model, using a so-called confidence metric. The most accurate model is expected to be ranked at the top. For AlphaFold 2 Multimer, it has been found that more than 5 predictions are necessary to obtain accurate models; thus the standard pipeline outputs 25 models which can be later inspected.\n\nHowever, it is not always guaranteed that the most accurate prediction (compared to a ground structure structure) is always ranked at the top. Typically, a criterion is defined, and the top ranking model match that criterion, then the prediction is considered correct. In benchmarks, the top-N success rate is the number of correct predictions up to rank N. For instance, the top-1 success rate is the number of case with a successful top-1 prediction over the full dataset, the top-5 success rate consider all ranks up to 5, and so on. For a given set of prediction, the probability of finding a correct prediction increases.\n\nIn the case of protein complexes, it is notoriously hard to predict bound conformations using traditional docking techniques. The top-1 success rate for traditional methods (docking) is typically low (a few percent), and for these methods, it is often necessary to consider a wider pool of predictions along with complementary methods such as molecular dynamics to assess what is the likely correct method. AlphaFold 2 Multimer became the gold standard for protein complex predictions, and AlphaFold 3 extends to a much larger landscape of interactions, involving nearly all kinds of molecules in life science.\n\nOnce a satisfying prediction is obtained, downstream tasks may be performed with other tools than AlphaFold. Long molecular dynamics simulations can be used to sample the conformational landscape, identifying key functional domains, assessing the stability, performing mutagenesis analysis, and so on. Structure prediction is thus one of the early step in the drug discovery phases, and must be complemented with additional analyses.\n\n## **Is AlphaFold 2 obsolete?**\n\nWith the release of AlphaFold 3, one might wonder if AlphaFold 2 is now outdated. The answer is rather nuanced. While AlphaFold 3 offers improvements in specific areas like nucleic acid/protein predictions and ligand docking, AlphaFold 2 remains highly relevant.\n\nThe reality is that AlphaFold 2 has been integrated within more intricate workflows, which, in some cases, extends its use beyond simple structure prediction and, in other cases, significantly improves its performance in specific tasks such as multimeric predictions as witnessed from the results of CASP15 [14]. For example, AlphaFold 2 and ProteinMPNN have been integrated into a pipeline for a complete *de novo* complex protein fold design with targeted properties [23, 24]. Another example is protein complex prediction, which is highly improved through techniques like massive sampling and dropout layer activation during inference [15]. This improvement beyond base performance is done through slight tweaking, without re-training or fine-tuning the neural networks.\n\n## **Antibody-antigen modeling: A persistent challenge**\n\nOne particular shortcoming of the first release of the AlphaFold 2 pipeline is its lack of accuracy for predicting antibody-antigen or nanobody-antigen bound complexes [8]. The problem itself is notoriously difficult, and it comes as no surprise that the observed accuracy of AlphaFold 2 on many other tasks motivated further inquiry with respect to their performance on this specific use case. An initial benchmark showed very low success rate (~10%) in this area [8], compared to other tasks.\n\nIt has been argued that while the integration of coevolution data was as the source of AlphaFold 2\u2019s overall performance, such data do not exist for antibody-antigen binding, which partially explains this lack of accurate results.\n\nNevertheless, a much more recent study [17] highlighted increased performance for newer versions of AlphaFold Multimer (2.2 and 2.3) compared to the initial release. Moreover, novel strategies, such as the aforementioned augmented sampling approach, have shown larger leap in success rates. Indeed, a key feature of AlphaFold 2 (and successors) is the ability to rank its own predictions using predicted accuracy metrics: in massive sampling approaches, such metrics can be used to identify conformational models of relevance [16]. Using a benchmark dataset of 37 antibody-antigen complexes (not part of the training set of AlphaFold 2), it has been reported [17] that the top-1 success rate was ~60%, which is quite close to the ~64% top-1 success rate of AlphaFold 3 (albeit on a much larger dataset [7], sampling 1,000 seeds); similar metrics were reported by other groups as well on other benchmark datasets [9]. In less than two years, the top-1 success rate has been multiplied by a factor of 6!\n\nIf we consider larger pools of predictions from the top ranked one, up to top-25, the success-rate come close to 75% percent, meaning there is at least one correct prediction amongst 25, in 3 out of 4 cases. Combining physics-based approaches with deep-learning predictions typically increase complex structure prediction success rate. In massive sampling approaches, a large amount of predictions are analysed (a few thousands at least), and in practice correct predictions have a large probability of being retrieved in the set.\n\nAntibody\u2013antigen success rate by different AlphaFold versions/implementation. The success rate is calculated based on the percentage of cases that had at least one model among their top N predictions that met a specified level of CAPRI accuracy. Adapted from Ref. 17\n\n## **Powering up drug discovery with LensAI**\n\nAt MindWalk, we have integrated AlphaFold 2 into our LensAI platform to enhance drug discovery workflows. The platform allows users to perform protein structure predictions within an optimized environment that balances speed and accuracy. Most comparable services contain limitations such as limited sequence lengths or reduced database search (~600 GB of storage, compared to the 2.62 TB of storage for the full database), which are tradeoffs to accommodate heavy usage, with a potential drop in accuracy in some cases.\n\nAlphaFold workflows readily available in AWS HealthOmics Ready2Run.\n\nImprovements like GPU acceleration (at inference and structure relaxation levels) may be desired, especially if the input sequences are large. To further improve performance, parallelization (which is not a feature of the official DeepMind release) may be highly desired in the case of augmented sampling. Beyond standard structure prediction tasks, LensAI incorporates advanced features like automated reporting and augmented sampling to improve prediction confidence.\n\nMoreover, LensAI integrates AlphaFold into specialized pipelines such as Epitope Mapping and Affinity Maturation (a case study has been documented and is accessible in the following [link](https://www.biostrand.ai/insight-hub/use-cases) [[22](https://www.biostrand.ai/insight-hub/use-cases)]). These pipelines exploit state-of-the-art methodologies (physics- and data-driven approaches) to accelerate discovery rates in biotherapeutic research.\n\n## **Conclusion: The future of AI-driven structural biology**\n\nThe field of structural biology witnessed groundbreaking progress within the past few years. AlphaFold\u2019s journey from version 1 to version 3 represents a transformative leap in our ability to predict biological macromolecule structures with unprecedented accuracy. While AlphaFold 3 expands into new territories like nucleic acids and small molecules, it does not render its predecessor obsolete. Both versions offer unique strengths that can be leveraged depending on specific research needs and pave new ways toward more intricate *in silico* and *de novo* generation of biotherapeutics to be integrated within pre-clinical research workflows. As we continue to integrate these models into platforms like LensAI, we are improving our ability to predict protein structures and accelerating the entire drug discovery process\u2014from target identification to lead optimization. The future is bright for AI-driven structural biology, and MindWalk\u00a0is at the forefront of this exciting revolution.\n\n## **References**\n\n[1] <https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/press-release/> , consulted 2024/10/09\n\n[2] Jumper, John, et al. \"Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold.\" *Nature* 596.7873 (2021): 583-589.\n\n[3] <https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=6286436358625670901>, consulted 2024/10/21\n\n[4] <https://blog.biostrand.ai/explained-a-brief-look-into-alphafold-2> , consulted 2024/10/21\n\n[5] <https://blog.biostrand.ai/explained-how-to-plot-the-prediction-quality-metrics-with-alphafold2> , consulted 2024/10/21\n\n[6] <https://blog.biostrand.ai/scaling-up-structural-biology-with-alphafold2> , consulted 2024/10/21\n\n[7] Abramson, Josh, et al. \"Accurate structure prediction of biomolecular interactions with AlphaFold 3.\" *Nature* (2024): 1-3.\n\n[8] Yin, R., Feng, B.

We have unlocked a new paradigm of predictive accuracy in understanding our biomolecular world, allowing us to rationally design new medicines on a computer with unprecedented understanding and precision.\n\nWe are giving a glimpse at a subset of the powerful and expansive capabilities of the Isomorphic Labs Drug Design Engine (IsoDDE), a unified computational drug-design system, progressing beyond AlphaFold 3 (AF3) in its predictive accuracy and introducing new capabilities which bridge the gap between structure prediction and real-world drug discovery.\n\nWe demonstrate that our IsoDDE more than doubles the accuracy of AlphaFold 3 on a challenging protein-ligand structure prediction generalisation benchmark, predicts small molecule binding-affinities with accuracies that exceed gold-standard physics-based methods at a fraction of the time and cost, and is able to accurately identify novel binding pockets on target proteins using only the amino acid sequence as input.\n\nIsoDDE offers a scalable foundation for AI drug design, providing the predictive fidelity required to navigate novel biological systems with unprecedented accuracy.\n\nSince our [release of AlphaFold 3](https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/articles/alphafold-3-predicts-the-structure-and-interactions-of-all-of-lifes-molecules) in 2024 together with Google DeepMind, the field of AI drug discovery has moved at an extraordinary pace. Whilst AlphaFold 3 delivered a dramatic leap in performance from previous generations of structure prediction models, a key challenge remained: understanding biomolecular structures alone was not sufficient for unlocking real-world drug discovery programs *in silico* (on a computer).\n\nProgress in rational drug design - vital for solving human disease - requires highly accurate predictive models, across an expansive range of biochemical properties and interactions, that are able to work in concert with one another. Crucially, with so much of biological and chemical space still unexplored, these models need the ability to generalise their predictive power beyond their training sets to novel, unseen systems.\n\nAs we continue to address these challenges, we are excited to introduce the Isomorphic Labs Drug Design Engine (IsoDDE), and to preview a subset of IsoDDE's capabilities below and in our technical report.\n\n[Read Our Technical Report](https://storage.googleapis.com/isomorphiclabs-website-public-artifacts/isodde_technical_report.pdf)\n\n## Structure Prediction of Truly Novel Systems\n\nAccurately predicting the structure of biomolecules and how they interact remains a crucial capability for rational drug design. Many critical downstream tasks are unlocked by being able to accurately model the small nuances in a protein\u2019s geometry - whether understanding the impact of disease-causing mutations, or predicting which molecules will bind to a target protein.\n\nAlphaFold 3 transformed protein-ligand structure prediction at the time of its release and the freely available AlphaFold Protein Database accelerated science on a scale that was previously unimaginable. To date, it has been used by over 3 million researchers in more than 190 countries.\n\nBenchmarks have subsequently revealed that there remained a gap in accuracy for structures that were dissimilar to the examples AlphaFold 3 had been trained on. In other words, that it can struggle to generalise to unexplored regions of biomolecular space where some of the biggest challenges and opportunities in drug discovery lie.\n\nIsoDDE demonstrates a step change in the ability to generalise to protein-ligand structures that are highly dissimilar to those in its training set.\n\nOn the 'Runs N' Poses' benchmark ([\u0160krinjar et al. 2025](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.03.636309v3)) - designed specifically to test generalisation to novel pockets and ligands - IsoDDE more than doubles the accuracy of AlphaFold 3 on the most difficult systems.\n\nIn the report, we demonstrate through several examples that we can successfully model complex, out-of-distribution events such as induced fits (where a protein adapts its shape to accommodate a bound ligand) and the opening of cryptic pockets (those hidden in the absence of a bound ligand) - critical biological mechanisms - even when these systems are distant from the training sets of such models.\n\nIsoDDE is able to successfully predict the structure of a protein-protein interaction inhibitor bound to a cryptic pocket on the NKG2D homo-dimer interface (8EA6) from the lowest 0-20 similarity bin of the Runs\u2019n\u2019Poses test set (AlphaFold 3 fails on this example)\n\n## Opening a New Window for Complex Biologics\n\nBut small molecules (like aspirin) are only one piece of the puzzle. As therapeutic modalities expand toward complex biologics (like insulin), the ability to accurately model antibody-antigen interfaces is paramount.\n\nIsoDDE provides a step change in accuracy for this domain. It outperforms AlphaFold 3 by 2.3x and Boltz-2 by 19.8x in the high-fidelity regime (DockQ > 0.8) on a challenging, novel antibody-antigen test set.\n\nCrucially, IsoDDE shows remarkable performance on the CDR-H3 loop - the most variable and difficult part of an antibody to predict - effectively unlocking new possibilities for *de novo* antibody design.\n\n## A New Gold-Standard for Binding Affinity Prediction\n\nKnowing the 3D structure of a biochemical system is only the first step; effective drug optimisation requires knowing how strongly a molecule will bind to its target.\n\nTraditional approaches are either limited to chemical space similar to the training data or by their high computational cost and difficulty of execution (e.g., physics-based approaches). Deep-learning based methods have more recently emerged that bring new speed to this task, but still lag behind physics-based approaches for accuracy.\n\nIsoDDE surpasses all deep-learning methods by a considerable margin on three public benchmarks - FEP+ 4, OpenFE, and the recent CASP16 blind binding affinity prediction task.\n\nIn fact, remarkably, IsoDDE can surpass the performance of physics-based methods such as FEP, despite the fact that these require grounding in experimental crystal structures and IsoDDE does not.\n\nBy delivering highly accurate binding affinity predictions at speed, IsoDDE allows researchers to rapidly rank and optimise potential molecules across diverse chemical series during drug design programs.\n\n## Expanding the Ligandable Proteome\n\nThe ability to identify all of the potential pockets on a protein, in the *absence* of a known ligand, unlocks a number of unique opportunities. Whether dealing with a first-in-class drug discovery target lacking structural annotation or pursuing a novel way to modulate a well-studied protein, a general pocket identification capability can be used to reveal the full set of possible mechanisms of action to pursue for molecular design.\n\nIsoDDE exhibits the capability to identify novel, ligandable pockets even in the absence of a known ligand and far from the model\u2019s training set. This capacity for \u2018blind\u2019 pocket identification demonstrates performance levels approaching experimental techniques like fragment-soaking which require large investments in time, significant cost and real-world experimental work. In comparison, IsoDDE runs on a computer in a matter of seconds.\n\nWe can see the power of this capability in the example of cereblon - a substrate receptor for the CRL4 E3 ligase complex - which plays a key role in tagging damaged or misfolded proteins for proteasomal degradation. For the last 15 years, it was believed that there was one principal way to drug cereblon: through the classic thalidomide-binding pocket. However, a recent study ([Dippon et al. 2026](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09994-w)) experimentally discovered a novel binding pocket that was both allosteric (away from the traditional binding site) and cryptic (hidden in the absence of a binding ligand).\n\nIsoDDE was able to recapitulate the discovery of this pocket, predicting the location of both the known and the novel cryptic sites using only the sequence of cereblon as input, without specifying the identity of the ligands. Further, once the ligands were specified, IsoDDE was able to correctly fold them into their respective pockets in the correct orientation.\n\n## Advancing Drug Discovery\n\nIsoDDE represents a leap forward in accuracy and capability, bringing deeper understanding to the molecular machines that make up the human body, and advancing the process of designing drugs to modulate them.\n\nOur dedicated drug design teams at Isomorphic Labs are using these capabilities every day across our programs \u2013 to understand unseen structures, identify uncharacterised pockets, and create novel chemical matter in the pursuit of new medicines for patients.\n\nWe look forward to continuing to push the frontiers of *in silico* drug design and bringing our new, more powerful capabilities to bear on historically challenging drug targets.\n\n*We thank our friends at Google DeepMind for productive discussions and collaboration.*\n\nRelated\n\n\u00a9 2026 ISOMORPHIC LABS\n\n[Home](/)[Life at

Hassabis, John Jumper, Pushmeet Kohli and Anna Koivuniemi on behalf of the AlphaFold team\n\nSince 2020, AlphaFold has accelerated the pace of science and fueled a global wave of biological discovery \u2014 an achievement recognized with a Nobel Prize\n\nFive years ago, AlphaFold 2 solved the protein structure prediction problem, unlocking new avenues of biological research and providing our first major proof point that AI can be a powerful tool to advance science.\n\nProteins are the complex, microscopic machines that drive every process in a living cell. Composed of long, unique chains of amino acids, they precisely fold into a 3D structure that largely defines the protein\u2019s function - making knowledge of this shape critical for drug discovery and understanding disease.\n\nIf a protein misfolds, it can lose its function and lead to disease, like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s. For decades, determining these structures was a monumental task, often taking a year or more of expensive, painstaking experimental work.\n\nAt the CASP 14 (Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction) competition in 2020, AlphaFold 2 predicted the structures of proteins based just on their amino acid sequences with astonishing accuracy - an achievement widely hailed as a solution to this 50-year-old grand challenge in biology. But the true, lasting impact of this breakthrough came when we put AlphaFold in the hands of the research community.\n\n## A global engine for discovery\n\nIn 2021, we launched the [AlphaFold Protein Database](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/?utm_source=deepmind.google&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=gdm&utm_content=) in partnership with [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/), which was a tipping point toward AlphaFold becoming a scientific tool adopted around the world. And one year later, we released AlphaFold 2\u2019s predictions for more than 200 million protein structures, achieving what would take hundreds of millions of years to solve experimentally.\n\nThe freely available AlphaFold Protein Database has accelerated science on a scale that was previously unimaginable. It has been used by over 3 million researchers in more than 190 countries, including over 1 million users in low- and middle-income countries. Over 30% of AlphaFold-related research is focused on better understanding disease, benefiting human welfare.\n\nThe profound scientific and societal value of this work was recognized in 2024 with the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n\n## Real-world transformation\n\nAlphaFold has become a standard tool for scientists tackling some of the world's most pressing issues, from conservation to heart health.\n\n### Breeding healthier and stronger honeybees\n\nScientists in Europe used AlphaFold to understand a key immunity protein in honeybees, Vitellogenin (Vg). These structural insights are now being applied to conservation efforts for endangered bee populations and guiding the development of AI-assisted breeding programs for healthier, more resilient pollinators.\n\n[Learn more](/blog/breeding-healthier-and-stronger-honeybees/)\n\n### Revealing a key protein behind heart disease\n\nAtherosclerosis, caused by \u201cbad cholesterol\u201d (LDL), is the leading cause of global mortality. For decades, the structure of the central protein in LDL, apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100), remained elusive. AlphaFold 2 helped finally reveal its complex, cage-like shape. This long-awaited blueprint gives pharmaceutical researchers the atomic-level detail needed to design new preventative heart therapies.\n\n[Learn more](/blog/revealing-a-key-protein-behind-heart-disease/)\n\n[Read more about AlphaFold\u2019s impact](/science/alphafold/)\n\n## Revolutionizing Research\n\nAlphaFold is also transforming scientific research - broadening access, accelerating timelines and dramatically lowering the cost.\n\n### Expanding access\n\nTurkish undergraduate students Alper and Taner Karag\u00f6l taught themselves structural biology during the pandemic using [online AlphaFold tutorials](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/alphafold/?utm_source=deepmind.google&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=gdm&utm_content=) \u2013 with no prior training. They've now published 15 research papers.\n\n### Increasing speed of discovery\n\nCyril Zipfel, professor of Molecular & Cellular Plant Physiology at the University of Zurich and Sainsbury Lab, saw research timelines shrink drastically. They used AlphaFold alongside comparative genomics to better understand how plants perceive changes in their environment, paving the way for more resilient crops.\n\nAlphaFold has been cited in more than 35,000 papers and more than 200,000 papers incorporated elements of AlphaFold 2 in their methodology. It\u2019s also enhancing the quality of work being produced.\n\nAn [independent analysis](https://www.innovationgrowthlab.org/resources/ai-in-science-alphafold-2) of AlphaFold 2\u2019s impact, carried out by the Innovation Growth Lab, suggests that researchers using AlphaFold 2 see an increase of over 40% in their submission of novel experimental protein structures. Those protein structures are more likely to be dissimilar to known structures, encouraging the exploration of uncharted areas of science. Also, research linked to AlphaFold 2 is twice as likely to be cited in clinical articles, and is significantly more likely to be cited by a patent, than typical works in structural biology.\n\n## A new era of digital biology\n\nOne of the most exciting examples of AlphaFold's impact is [Isomorphic Labs](https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/) \u2013 an AI drug discovery company founded in 2021 when the breakthrough model proved to be powerful enough to be applied to rational drug design. Isomorphic Labs has since developed a unified drug design engine to dramatically change how it designs new medicines and speed up scientific discovery with an ambition to one day solve all diseases.\n\nTogether with Isomorphic Labs, we developed [AlphaFold 3](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-deepmind-isomorphic-alphafold-3-ai-model/?utm_source=deepmind.google&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=gdm&utm_content=), which offers an unprecedented view into cells that we expect to drive a transformation of the drug discovery process and usher in an era of \"digital biology.\"\n\nThe model is designed to predict the structure and interactions of all of life's molecules \u2014 not just proteins, but DNA, RNA, and ligands (the small molecules that make up most drugs). It can also generate the joint 3D structures of entire molecular complexes, allowing a holistic view of how a potential drug molecule binds to its target protein, or how proteins interact with genetic material.\n\nThe [AlphaFold Server](https://alphafoldserver.com/welcome) is empowering non-commercial researchers globally to harness this technology, accelerating their ability to formulate and test new hypotheses. So far, it\u2019s helped make more than 8 million folds - predictions of structures and interactions - for thousands of researchers around the world.\n\n## The future of AI for science\n\nInspired by AlphaFold, we\u2019ve developed a new generation of models to solve problems across biology. [AlphaMissense](https://deepmind.google/blog/a-catalogue-of-genetic-mutations-to-help-pinpoint-the-cause-of-diseases/) and [AlphaGenome](https://deepmind.google/blog/alphagenome-ai-for-better-understanding-the-genome/) use AI to assess the genetic mutations that underpin disease. Our [AlphaProteo](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphaproteo-generates-novel-proteins-for-biology-and-health-research/) model can design novel, high-strength protein binders that target diverse molecules \u2013 including those associated with cancer and diabetes. These models are deepening our understanding of complex diseases and ultimately driving the development of new treatments.\n\nBiology was our first frontier, but we view AlphaFold as the template for how AI can accelerate all of science to digital speed. From [fusion](https://deepmind.google/blog/bringing-ai-to-the-next-generation-of-fusion-energy/) and [Earth sciences](https://deepmind.google/blog/alphaearth-foundations-helps-map-our-planet-in-unprecedented-detail/) to [scientific discovery](https://deepmind.google/blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/) as a whole, we\u2019re pursuing the next AlphaFold-like breakthroughs. We\u2019re excited to continue partnering with the global scientific community, empowering researchers everywhere to tackle the biggest challenges facing humanity.\n\n[Visit our AlphaFold

does AlphaFold 3 work?\n==========================\n\nBeta\n\nGot questions? Feel free to ask [Ada](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/ada), our training AI assistant.\n\nAlphaFold 3 is built on similar general principles as AlphaFold 2 (for more on AlphaFold 2, see section [AlphaFold 2: A high-level overview](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/alphafold/inputs-and-outputs/a-high-level-overview/)).\n\nMany practical details remain the same, notably the use of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) as the main input of the neural network. Furthermore, the overall architecture of AlphaFold 3 retains a familiar structure, that of AlphaFold 2, where a large trunk processes a pairwise representation of the chemical complex, which is then used by a structure module to generate explicit atomic positions.\n\nHowever, despite these foundational similarities, AlphaFold 3\u2019s architecture has substantially improved over AlphaFold 2. The new architecture accommodates more general chemical structures and improves the data efficiency of learning.\n\n![Image 2](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/alphafold/wp-content/uploads/sites/259/2025/06/AFS-Education-Figure-2-240828-r01-1024x265.png)\n\nFigure 35. The architecture of AlphaFold 3. Rectangles represent processing modules, while arrows show the flow of data. Yellow, input data; blue, abstract network activations; green, output data. The coloured spheres represent physical atom coordinates.\n\nFor instance, to reduce the amount of MSA processing, AlphaFold 3 replaces AlphaFold 2\u2019s Evoformer with a new Pairformer module that has a smaller and simpler MSA embedding block. Some of AlphaFold 3\u2019s advancements, notably its improved performance predictions of antigen-antibody complexes, are directly related to its reduced dependence on the MSA signal. Nevertheless, for protein structure prediction, AlphaFold 3 still makes heavy use of co-evolutionary data from the MSA.\n\nCrucially, AlphaFold 3 predicts the coordinates of individual atoms within a complex. This is distinct from AlphaFold 2, which predicted the positions of amino acid residues and their side chains. The new approach gives AlphaFold 3 the computational flexibility to tackle different types of molecules.\n\n### Tokenisation\n\nA further change in AlphaFold 3, compared to AlphaFold 2, is how the system subdivides a complex. Both divide the complex of interest into \u201ctokens\u201d. In AlphaFold 2, tokens directly correspond to amino acids, reflecting the system\u2019s strict focus on protein structures. In contrast, AlphaFold 3 is designed to effectively model chemically different molecules, ranging from ions and small molecule ligands to macromolecules made of hundreds of amino acids or nucleotides. A one-token-per-atom approach for the whole structure, including proteins and nucleic acids, would offer the maximum flexibility: however, memory constraints necessitate a compromise.\n\nThus, AlphaFold 3\u2019s tokenisation strategy balances the need for flexibility required for small molecules with computational practicality. Hence, a token may correspond to:\n\n*   One standard amino acid in the protein chain\n*   One standard nucleotide in the nucleic acid chain\n*   One atom of a ligand\n*   One atom of an ion\n*   One atom of a chemically-modified amino acid residue or nucleotide. In order to predict the structure of a chemically-modified amino acid residue or nucleotide, AlphaFold 3 will tokenise the entire residue/nucleotide as atoms. In other words, these are treated more like ligands than standard amino acids or nucleotides.\n\nTo understand this, consider a structure made of 100 amino acid residues and a ligand containing 20 atoms. AlphaFold 3 will represent this structure using 100 + 20 = 120 tokens. This is important because confidence metrics like PAE (see subsection \u201c[Interpreting results from AlphaFold Server](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/alphafold/interpreting-results-from-alphafold-server/)\u201c) are now calculated for tokens rather than amino acids.\n\n![Image 3](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/alphafold/wp-content/uploads/sites/259/2025/06/tokens.png)\n\nFigure 36. Illustrating tokenisation. Here, three amino acid residues take three tokens to model; three nucleotides take three tokens as well, and one citric acid takes 13 tokens, for 13 non-hydrogen atoms in this ligand. \n\n### Diffusion\n\nAlphaFold 3 predicts raw atom coordinates using a diffusion module, making it a \u201cgenerative\u201d ML model. Generative models create new data similar to the examples they learn from: in the case of AlphaFold 3, structures from the Protein Data Bank. This contrasts with non-generative models like AlphaFold 2, which identify patterns in the existing data.\n\nDiffusion is a standard technique in machine learning. First, a high-information dataset is distorted by varying levels of random noise; subsequently, the neural network learns to restore it to the original data. The system uses a conditioning description for each example that should be restored. For example, when generating images, a typical conditioning might be a text description of the final image. During training, the network learns to generate plausible data to fit any given conditioning by incrementally stepping from pure noise to the final output.\n\nIn AlphaFold 3, the diffusion module was trained to receive \u201cnoised\u201d atomic coordinates and predict the correct coordinates. The conditioning information is the sequence information for the target molecule or complex.\n\nFor more details on the internal mechanics of AlphaFold 3, see the Supplementary Material to the AlphaFold 3 paper ([Abramson et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07487-w)).\n\nOverview of AlphaFold 3 outputs\n-------------------------------\n\nAlphaFold 3 outputs the predicted structure of a protein or complex, returning the coordinates of all atoms in the mmCIF format. By default, AlphaFold 3 produces five predicted structures from a single seed. These are generated by sampling the diffusion process five times.\n\nAs with AlphaFold 2, AlphaFold 3 supplies multiple confidence metrics to help you critically assess its predictions:\n\n*   **Predicted LDDT (pLDDT):**predicted atomic coordinates are accompanied by pLDDT scores. These reflect AlphaFold 3\u2019s local confidence in the prediction of the position of that particular atom.\n*   **Predicted Aligned Error (PAE) scores and a PAE plot:** an indication of AlphaFold\u2019s confidence in the packing and relative positions of domains, molecular chains such as proteins and DNA, and other entities like ligands and ions.\n*   **Predicted TM (pTM) score**: a single-value metric reflecting the accuracy of the overall predicted structure.\n*   **Interface-predicted TM (ipTM) score:**measures the accuracy of predictions of one component of the complex relative to the other components of the complex.\n*   **Per chain pTM and per-chain pair ipTM:**confidence in individual chains or pairs of chains.\n\n* * *\n\n![Image

These tools have revolutionized structural biology with their highly accurate predictions, driving progress in protein modeling, drug discovery, and the study of protein dynamics. Its exceptional accuracy has redefined our understanding of protein folding, which enables groundbreaking advancements in protein design, disease research and discusses future integration with experimental techniques. In addition, their achievement features, architectures, important case studies, and noteworthy effects in the field of biology and medicine were evaluated. In consideration of the fact that AF2 is a relatively recent innovation, it has already been taken into account in many studies that highlight its applications in many ways. Moreover, the limitations of AF2 that directed to the introduction of AF3 are also reported, which is a great improvement as it provides precise predictions of the structures and interactions of proteins, DNA, RNA, and ligands, thereby aiding in the understanding of the molecular level. Addressing current challenges and forecasting future developments, this work underscores the lasting significance of AF in reshaping the scientific landscape of protein research.\n\n**Keywords:**  AlphaFold2; AlphaFold3; Artificial intelligence; DeepMind; Protein structure prediction.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

Nature\u2019s versatile biological machines, proteins, are composed of strings of amino acids that fold into complex, dynamic shapes\u2014like origami. The function of the protein is determined by its structure, which, in turn, depends on the amino acid sequence.\n\nThe vision of engineering custom proteins with specified properties and functions by designing a specific amino acid sequence has captivated scientists for a long time. The problem is that protein sequence space is practically immeasurable, and trying to engineer a protein to perform a specific function is a Sisyphean task. For decades, protein engineers evolved functions\u2014such as an enzyme\u2019s thermostability or substrate affinity\u2014in the lab using a method called directed evolution. Alternatively, they would attempt to rationally design the desired functions by looking at the protein structure (a 3D model obtained through X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy) and trying to figure out which protein regions they needed to change, followed by making hundreds of different mutated variants and testing them in the lab.\n\nAs artificial intelligence continues to transform protein engineering, thought leaders and startup pioneers alike will converge at this year\u2019s [SynBioBeta: The Global Synthetic Biology Conference](https://www.synbiobeta.com/events/synbiobeta-2025) to discuss the latest breakthroughs in generative models for protein design. Presenters will highlight how these computational tools are fast becoming an essential driver of innovation across the synthetic biology landscape.\n\n#### The AlphaFold Revolution\n\nGiven the arduous and inefficient nature of engineering proteins in the lab, the field was long overdue for a computational makeover. However, until about 2018, the computational power required to solve a protein structure was considered unattainable. Back in 1969, molecular biologist Cyrus Levinthal estimated that it would take longer than the age of the known universe to solve the protein folding problem since a typical-length protein can fold into 10300 possible configurations. But that doesn\u2019t mean no one has tried it.\n\nSince the late 1980s, scientists developed molecular physics-based models to try to figure out the rules of protein folding. To compare how well the different models worked, researchers established the [Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction](https://predictioncenter.org/) (CASP) challenge, a protein structure prediction competition that began in 1994. In the course of the competition, teams would attempt to solve the structure of a protein based on their models and then compare those predictions with experimentally determined structures.\n\nThe majority of the initial models, such as [Rosetta](https://rosettacommons.org/software/) developed in 2024 Nobel Laurate [David Baker\u2019s lab](https://www.bakerlab.org/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), were physics-based. While these models could accurately describe the thermodynamic forces driving protein folding, they lacked the computational power to brute-force 10300 possible configurations. The development of deep learning algorithms in the early 2010s was a breakthrough moment for protein structure prediction. In 2018, a team from [DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/), the UK artificial intelligence lab bought by Google in 2014, entered into the thirteenth CASP competition with a model called AlphaFold and [placed first](https://www.forbes.com/sites/samshead/2018/12/03/deepmind-starts-to-show-how-ai-can-be-used-to-solve-scientific-problems/). By the next competition in 2020, AlphaFold 2, a revamped algorithm from DeepMind, left all other models in the dust.\n\nAlphaFold, which won the [2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/press-release/) for its researchers, was a true breakthrough in protein folding prediction. AlphaFold is a neural network-based model that predicts protein structures with atomic accuracy without requiring nearly as much computational power as physics-based models. To do that, the algorithm first searches genetic databases for similar protein sequences and creates a multiple-sequence alignment. Then, it generates a pairwise representation to encode spatial relationships between amino acids. The refined pairwise information is passed through a transformer network to produce a final prediction of the protein's structure.\n\nThis AI tool has revolutionized biology, enabling the design of new proteins for medicine, energy, and sustainability. Since 2020, AlphaFold has been used to predict the structures of millions of proteins, making waves across the scientific community. (As of the writing of this article, the [Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2) describing AlphaFold has been cited 32998 times). The latest AlphaFold 3 model is [freely available](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-deepmind-isomorphic-alphafold-3-ai-model/) for non-commercial research use, democratizing protein engineering\u2014something we could not have even imagined a decade ago.\n\n#### Beyond AlphaFold\n\nSince the breakthrough of AlphaFold, other AI models have been developed by academic labs and biotech companies, including\u00a0 [EvoBind](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.23.501214v1), [ESMFold](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade2574), and [RFDiffusion](https://www.bakerlab.org/2023/07/11/diffusion-model-for-protein-design/), which can predict protein structure and function, as well as elucidate the folding of other molecule types (DNA and RNA) and model complex molecular interactions between proteins and their ligands.\n\n[RFdiffusion](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06415-8) is a model built on an open-source algorithm called [RoseTTAFold](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj8754), developed by David Baker\u2019s lab. It generates new protein structures in a manner similar to how DALL-E or Midjourney generate art. This tool was able to solve new design challenges, including molecular binding and oligomer design. Both RoseTTAFold and RFdiffusion have since then been upgraded to [All-Atom](https://www.ipd.uw.edu/2023/10/introducing-rosettafold-and-rfdiffusion-all-atom/) versions, which enable modeling of not just proteins but biological complexes made from different molecules, including DNA, RNA, small molecules, metals, and other bonded atoms.\n\nAs large language models like ChatGPT took the world by storm, scientists realized that you can use them for proteins as well\u2014and this has turned out to be a very successful strategy. These gigantic models trained on extensive volumes of data enable scientists to generate de novo designs based not on protein structure but function. Dubbed [protein language models](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-86519-5) (PLMs), these tools are a lot more accessible for researchers because tuning a natural language model is much easier than developing conventional machine learning algorithms.\n\nThe progress in generative AI for protein design is by no means finished. Researchers are still working to refine the algorithms to create better proteins for specific applications, as well as expand the capabilities of what is possible for biology in the age of AI. Last month, NVIDIA released [GenMol](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/evaluating-genmol-as-a-generalist-foundation-model-for-molecular-generation/), a foundational model for molecular generation. GenMol offers a versatile molecular generative framework based on discrete diffusion and non-autoregressive decoding designed to streamline drug discovery from molecule design to lead optimization.\n\n#### Generative Design in Synthetic Biology\n\nSo, what does this mean for synthetic biology and the bioeconomy?\n\nThe dream of being able to design custom proteins has finally come true. For example, we can make new enzymes that are stable at high temperatures. Using enzymes that do not degrade in high-temperature industrial processes (such as making paper from wood pulp) translates into millions of dollars in savings. AI is also revolutionizing drug discovery research by allowing scientists to model how proteins and small-molecule drugs interact with their targets. Additionally, we can engineer proteins that have no equivalents in nature\u2014which could help us solve the challenges of the twenty-first century.\n\nCompanies such as [Cradle](https://www.cradle.bio/) have been using protein language models to design better [enzymes](https://www.cradle.bio/blog/case-study-combining-ai-generated-mutations-with-human-expertise-for-better-enzyme-designs), [receptor-binding proteins](https://www.cradle.bio/blog/adaptyv-protein-design-competition), and [antibodies](https://www.cradle.bio/blog/antibody-ngs-data-initiative), with applications across the entire biotechnology spectrum, from industrial and food biotech to biopharma. [Absci](https://www.absci.com/) is transforming the biologics discovery pipeline by enabling [de novo](https://www.synbiobeta.com/read/absci-and-amd-team-up-to-revolutionize-drug-discovery-with-ai) antibody design. And [Ginkgo\u2019s](https://www.ginkgo.bio/) models have been able to improve [PETase activity](https://foundrytheory.substack.com/p/the-petase-mask-fill-challenge), an enzyme capable of degrading plastic.\n\nAs the recent [Advanced Biotech for Sustainability (AB4S](https://www.ab4s.org/report)) [report](https://www.ab4s.org/report) highlights, advanced biotechnology could reduce global emissions by 5% and generate $1 trillion in economic value across the food, agriculture, chemicals, personal care, and transportation fuels sectors. With generative AI becoming a mainstay in biotechnology, transforming the world through synthetic biology is no longer a pipe dream\u2014it is just a work in progress.\n\n###### Read More\n\n[View All](../read)\n\nAaron Blotnick\n\nFeb 11, 2026\n\n###### [Burn, Baby, Burn: EPA Moves to Dismantle the Legal Backbone of U.S. Climate Policy](./burn-baby-burn-epa-moves-to-dismantle-the-legal-backbone-of-u.s.-climate-policy)\n\nAaron Blotnick\n\nFeb 11, 2026\n\n###### [Burn, Baby, Burn: EPA Moves to Dismantle the Legal Backbone of U.S. Climate Policy](./burn-baby-burn-epa-moves-to-dismantle-the-legal-backbone-of-u.s.-climate-policy)\n\n[Longevity](../)\n\nAaron Blotnick\n\nFeb 10, 2026\n\n###### [J.

frontier in macromolecular structure prediction\n\n13:26\n\nRead time 9 min\n\n## **Introduction**\n\nAs a testament to the recent breakthrough of deep-learning technologies in the field of (structural) bioinformatics, half of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2024 [[1](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/press-release/)] has been awarded to John Jumper and Demis Hassabis, the main contributors to AlphaFold 2, the other half to Prof. David Baker (University of Washington, Seattle). Speaking about breakthroughs is not an understatement: as of this time of writing, the original AlphaFold2 publication [2] has been cited more than 27,800 times (according to Google Scholar [[3](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=6286436358625670901)]). For comparison, on Feb 21, 2023 (roughly 1.5 years ago), the number of citations was just 8,783. AlphaFold 2 is a solution to the protein folding problem and can predict with near experimental accuracy the structure of proteins as long as their primary structures (the sequence of amino acids along the protein chain) are known. This technology has been integrated with the LensAI\u2071\u2122 *in silico* discovery platform, and we have discussed it in length in different blog posts since the public release of AlphaFold2 [[4](https://blog.biostrand.ai/explained-a-brief-look-into-alphafold-2), [5](https://blog.biostrand.ai/explained-how-to-plot-the-prediction-quality-metrics-with-alphafold2), [6](https://blog.biostrand.ai/scaling-up-structural-biology-with-alphafold2)]. In this new blog post, we will review how these latest developments are impacting drug discovery, what can be technically achieved with current technology, and assess limitations that hinder discovery processes and future outcomes. Finally, we will briefly present how these breakthrough technologies are integrated within the MindWalk LensAI\u00a0platform.\n\n## **AlphaFold 3: Expanding the horizons of structural biology**\n\nIn May 2024, DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs (a subsidiary of Alphabet founded by Demis Hassabis) released AlphaFold 3, with a closed-source web server accessible to academic researchers. At the protein structure prediction, AlphaFold 3 is an improvement over AlphaFold 2: it is better at predicting monomeric and multimeric structures [7], specifically in the field of antibody-antigen complex modeling where AlphaFold 2 was notoriously lacking [8].\n\nIn addition to proteins, AlphaFold 3 introduces capabilities for predicting the structures of nucleic acids (such as RNA) and small molecules. This expanded versatility makes it a powerful tool for drug discovery, as it can model the interactions between proteins and ligands. These substantial improvements are critical advancements for biotherapeutic development, where understanding these interactions is essential for developing targeted therapies like monoclonal antibodies and, in the broader sense, developing *in silico* screening strategies.\n\nWhile the authors' study in the original publication shows beyond state-of-the-art performance for many tasks, third-party benchmarks are still missing for AlphaFold 3, partly due to the limited capacity of the web server and its initial closed-source nature. As announced earlier in the year [[13](https://x.com/pushmeet/status/1790086453520691657)], the source code was released in November 2024, although with a restricted license; thus AlphaFold 3 is less susceptible to tweaking, in-depth analysis, and integration to protein design pipelines compared to AlphaFold 2 [[6](https://blog.biostrand.ai/scaling-up-structural-biology-with-alphafold2)].\n\nIn addition to the base AlphaFold 3 code, several third-party initiatives have taken the initiative to reproduce the architecture of the model, as it was done for AlphaFold 2 before its release [[3](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=6286436358625670901)], and many AlphaFold 3-like prediction pipelines have been released, such as Boltz-1 or Chai-1.\n\nAlphaFold 3 success rate on different benchmark sets, for (from the left to the right) ligand docking, nucleic acids, covalent modifications and protein predictions; and compared to state-of-the-art methods. Adapted from Ref. 7.\n\nSo far, the substantial improvements of AlphaFold 3 outbalance its known limitations: for instance, the algorithm struggles with molecule chirality. Atomic clashes also occur, specifically for large proteins, so molecules can partially overlap, which is physically impossible. As success rates for some tasks remain low, \u201challucinations\u201d may happen. Finally, predictions remain static in nature and completely ignore any dynamical aspect of molecular interaction. These limitations are, of course, not specific to AlphaFold 3, and there are many ways to mitigate these shortcomings by integrating structure prediction within a broader framework for molecular modeling. For instance, models generated by AlphaFold can be used in Molecular Dynamics simulations to assess conformational dynamics, interaction energies between molecular partners, and much more.\n\n## **Structure prediction in practice**\n\nDespite their fame, the practical use of structure prediction tools such as AlphaFold is not often well understood. These tools works within the paradigm that for a given input of sequential molecular data (sequence of amino acids for protein, nucleic acids, \u2026), there is a \u201cstatic\u201d 3D structure (atomic position) which can be predicted solely from this data, representative on the interaction between all involved atoms. While this picture is simplistic and ignores the dynamical nature of macromolecular interactions, which is only partially captured by static representations.\n\nWithin this paradigm, ideally, one would expect that a given input yields a single prediction. Yet, this is not the case. For AlphaFold 2 monomers, there are 5 trained model weights which outputs 5 predictions for a single inputs. These predictions are scored and ranked by the model, using a so-called confidence metric. The most accurate model is expected to be ranked at the top. For AlphaFold 2 Multimer, it has been found that more than 5 predictions are necessary to obtain accurate models; thus the standard pipeline outputs 25 models which can be later inspected.\n\nHowever, it is not always guaranteed that the most accurate prediction (compared to a ground structure structure) is always ranked at the top. Typically, a criterion is defined, and the top ranking model match that criterion, then the prediction is considered correct. In benchmarks, the top-N success rate is the number of correct predictions up to rank N. For instance, the top-1 success rate is the number of case with a successful top-1 prediction over the full dataset, the top-5 success rate consider all ranks up to 5, and so on. For a given set of prediction, the probability of finding a correct prediction increases.\n\nIn the case of protein complexes, it is notoriously hard to predict bound conformations using traditional docking techniques. The top-1 success rate for traditional methods (docking) is typically low (a few percent), and for these methods, it is often necessary to consider a wider pool of predictions along with complementary methods such as molecular dynamics to assess what is the likely correct method. AlphaFold 2 Multimer became the gold standard for protein complex predictions, and AlphaFold 3 extends to a much larger landscape of interactions, involving nearly all kinds of molecules in life science.\n\nOnce a satisfying prediction is obtained, downstream tasks may be performed with other tools than AlphaFold. Long molecular dynamics simulations can be used to sample the conformational landscape, identifying key functional domains, assessing the stability, performing mutagenesis analysis, and so on. Structure prediction is thus one of the early step in the drug discovery phases, and must be complemented with additional analyses.\n\n## **Is AlphaFold 2 obsolete?**\n\nWith the release of AlphaFold 3, one might wonder if AlphaFold 2 is now outdated. The answer is rather nuanced. While AlphaFold 3 offers improvements in specific areas like nucleic acid/protein predictions and ligand docking, AlphaFold 2 remains highly relevant.\n\nThe reality is that AlphaFold 2 has been integrated within more intricate workflows, which, in some cases, extends its use beyond simple structure prediction and, in other cases, significantly improves its performance in specific tasks such as multimeric predictions as witnessed from the results of CASP15 [14]. For example, AlphaFold 2 and ProteinMPNN have been integrated into a pipeline for a complete *de novo* complex protein fold design with targeted properties [23, 24]. Another example is protein complex prediction, which is highly improved through techniques like massive sampling and dropout layer activation during inference [15]. This improvement beyond base performance is done through slight tweaking, without re-training or fine-tuning the neural networks.\n\n## **Antibody-antigen modeling: A persistent challenge**\n\nOne particular shortcoming of the first release of the AlphaFold 2 pipeline is its lack of accuracy for predicting antibody-antigen or nanobody-antigen bound complexes [8]. The problem itself is notoriously difficult, and it comes as no surprise that the observed accuracy of AlphaFold 2 on many other tasks motivated further inquiry with respect to their performance on this specific use case. An initial benchmark showed very low success rate (~10%) in this area [8], compared to other tasks.\n\nIt has been argued that while the integration of coevolution data was as the source of AlphaFold 2\u2019s overall performance, such data do not exist for antibody-antigen binding, which partially explains this lack of accurate results.\n\nNevertheless, a much more recent study [17] highlighted increased performance for newer versions of AlphaFold Multimer (2.2 and 2.3) compared to the initial release. Moreover, novel strategies, such as the aforementioned augmented sampling approach, have shown larger leap in success rates. Indeed, a key feature of AlphaFold 2 (and successors) is the ability to rank its own predictions using predicted accuracy metrics: in massive sampling approaches, such metrics can be used to identify conformational models of relevance [16]. Using a benchmark dataset of 37 antibody-antigen complexes (not part of the training set of AlphaFold 2), it has been reported [17] that the top-1 success rate was ~60%, which is quite close to the ~64% top-1 success rate of AlphaFold 3 (albeit on a much larger dataset [7], sampling 1,000 seeds); similar metrics were reported by other groups as well on other benchmark datasets [9]. In less than two years, the top-1 success rate has been multiplied by a factor of 6!\n\nIf we consider larger pools of predictions from the top ranked one, up to top-25, the success-rate come close to 75% percent, meaning there is at least one correct prediction amongst 25, in 3 out of 4 cases. Combining physics-based approaches with deep-learning predictions typically increase complex structure prediction success rate. In massive sampling approaches, a large amount of predictions are analysed (a few thousands at least), and in practice correct predictions have a large probability of being retrieved in the set.\n\nAntibody\u2013antigen success rate by different AlphaFold versions/implementation. The success rate is calculated based on the percentage of cases that had at least one model among their top N predictions that met a specified level of CAPRI accuracy. Adapted from Ref. 17\n\n## **Powering up drug discovery with LensAI**\n\nAt MindWalk, we have integrated AlphaFold 2 into our LensAI platform to enhance drug discovery workflows. The platform allows users to perform protein structure predictions within an optimized environment that balances speed and accuracy. Most comparable services contain limitations such as limited sequence lengths or reduced database search (~600 GB of storage, compared to the 2.62 TB of storage for the full database), which are tradeoffs to accommodate heavy usage, with a potential drop in accuracy in some cases.\n\nAlphaFold workflows readily available in AWS HealthOmics Ready2Run.\n\nImprovements like GPU acceleration (at inference and structure relaxation levels) may be desired, especially if the input sequences are large. To further improve performance, parallelization (which is not a feature of the official DeepMind release) may be highly desired in the case of augmented sampling. Beyond standard structure prediction tasks, LensAI incorporates advanced features like automated reporting and augmented sampling to improve prediction confidence.\n\n[... 731 more lines.

These pipelines exploit state-of-the-art methodologies (physics- and data-driven approaches) to accelerate discovery rates in biotherapeutic research.\n\n## **Conclusion: The future of AI-driven structural biology**\n\nThe field of structural biology witnessed groundbreaking progress within the past few years. AlphaFold\u2019s journey from version 1 to version 3 represents a transformative leap in our ability to predict biological macromolecule structures with unprecedented accuracy. While AlphaFold 3 expands into new territories like nucleic acids and small molecules, it does not render its predecessor obsolete. Both versions offer unique strengths that can be leveraged depending on specific research needs and pave new ways toward more intricate *in silico* and *de novo* generation of biotherapeutics to be integrated within pre-clinical research workflows. As we continue to integrate these models into platforms like LensAI, we are improving our ability to predict protein structures and accelerating the entire drug discovery process\u2014from target identification to lead optimization. The future is bright for AI-driven structural biology, and MindWalk\u00a0is at the forefront of this exciting revolution.\n\n## **References**\n\n[1] <https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/press-release/> , consulted 2024/10/09\n\n[2] Jumper, John, et al. \"Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold.\" *Nature* 596.7873 (2021): 583-589.\n\n[3] <https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=6286436358625670901>, consulted 2024/10/21\n\n[4] <https://blog.biostrand.ai/explained-a-brief-look-into-alphafold-2> , consulted 2024/10/21\n\n[5] <https://blog.biostrand.ai/explained-how-to-plot-the-prediction-quality-metrics-with-alphafold2> , consulted 2024/10/21\n\n[6] <https://blog.biostrand.ai/scaling-up-structural-biology-with-alphafold2> , consulted 2024/10/21\n\n[7] Abramson, Josh, et al. \"Accurate structure prediction of biomolecular interactions with AlphaFold 3.\" *Nature* (2024): 1-3.\n\n[8] Yin, R., Feng, B.

We have unlocked a new paradigm of predictive accuracy in understanding our biomolecular world, allowing us to rationally design new medicines on a computer with unprecedented understanding and precision.\n\nWe are giving a glimpse at a subset of the powerful and expansive capabilities of the Isomorphic Labs Drug Design Engine (IsoDDE), a unified computational drug-design system, progressing beyond AlphaFold 3 (AF3) in its predictive accuracy and introducing new capabilities which bridge the gap between structure prediction and real-world drug discovery.\n\nWe demonstrate that our IsoDDE more than doubles the accuracy of AlphaFold 3 on a challenging protein-ligand structure prediction generalisation benchmark, predicts small molecule binding-affinities with accuracies that exceed gold-standard physics-based methods at a fraction of the time and cost, and is able to accurately identify novel binding pockets on target proteins using only the amino acid sequence as input.\n\nIsoDDE offers a scalable foundation for AI drug design, providing the predictive fidelity required to navigate novel biological systems with unprecedented accuracy.\n\nSince our [release of AlphaFold 3](https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/articles/alphafold-3-predicts-the-structure-and-interactions-of-all-of-lifes-molecules) in 2024 together with Google DeepMind, the field of AI drug discovery has moved at an extraordinary pace. Whilst AlphaFold 3 delivered a dramatic leap in performance from previous generations of structure prediction models, a key challenge remained: understanding biomolecular structures alone was not sufficient for unlocking real-world drug discovery programs *in silico* (on a computer).\n\nProgress in rational drug design - vital for solving human disease - requires highly accurate predictive models, across an expansive range of biochemical properties and interactions, that are able to work in concert with one another. Crucially, with so much of biological and chemical space still unexplored, these models need the ability to generalise their predictive power beyond their training sets to novel, unseen systems.\n\nAs we continue to address these challenges, we are excited to introduce the Isomorphic Labs Drug Design Engine (IsoDDE), and to preview a subset of IsoDDE's capabilities below and in our technical report.\n\n[Read Our Technical Report](https://storage.googleapis.com/isomorphiclabs-website-public-artifacts/isodde_technical_report.pdf)\n\n## Structure Prediction of Truly Novel Systems\n\nAccurately predicting the structure of biomolecules and how they interact remains a crucial capability for rational drug design. Many critical downstream tasks are unlocked by being able to accurately model the small nuances in a protein\u2019s geometry - whether understanding the impact of disease-causing mutations, or predicting which molecules will bind to a target protein.\n\nAlphaFold 3 transformed protein-ligand structure prediction at the time of its release and the freely available AlphaFold Protein Database accelerated science on a scale that was previously unimaginable. To date, it has been used by over 3 million researchers in more than 190 countries.\n\nBenchmarks have subsequently revealed that there remained a gap in accuracy for structures that were dissimilar to the examples AlphaFold 3 had been trained on. In other words, that it can struggle to generalise to unexplored regions of biomolecular space where some of the biggest challenges and opportunities in drug discovery lie.\n\nIsoDDE demonstrates a step change in the ability to generalise to protein-ligand structures that are highly dissimilar to those in its training set.\n\nOn the 'Runs N' Poses' benchmark ([\u0160krinjar et al. 2025](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.03.636309v3)) - designed specifically to test generalisation to novel pockets and ligands - IsoDDE more than doubles the accuracy of AlphaFold 3 on the most difficult systems.\n\nIn the report, we demonstrate through several examples that we can successfully model complex, out-of-distribution events such as induced fits (where a protein adapts its shape to accommodate a bound ligand) and the opening of cryptic pockets (those hidden in the absence of a bound ligand) - critical biological mechanisms - even when these systems are distant from the training sets of such models.\n\nIsoDDE is able to successfully predict the structure of a protein-protein interaction inhibitor bound to a cryptic pocket on the NKG2D homo-dimer interface (8EA6) from the lowest 0-20 similarity bin of the Runs\u2019n\u2019Poses test set (AlphaFold 3 fails on this example)\n\n## Opening a New Window for Complex Biologics\n\nBut small molecules (like aspirin) are only one piece of the puzzle. As therapeutic modalities expand toward complex biologics (like insulin), the ability to accurately model antibody-antigen interfaces is paramount.\n\nIsoDDE provides a step change in accuracy for this domain. It outperforms AlphaFold 3 by 2.3x and Boltz-2 by 19.8x in the high-fidelity regime (DockQ > 0.8) on a challenging, novel antibody-antigen test set.\n\nCrucially, IsoDDE shows remarkable performance on the CDR-H3 loop - the most variable and difficult part of an antibody to predict - effectively unlocking new possibilities for *de novo* antibody design.\n\n## A New Gold-Standard for Binding Affinity Prediction\n\nKnowing the 3D structure of a biochemical system is only the first step; effective drug optimisation requires knowing how strongly a molecule will bind to its target.\n\nTraditional approaches are either limited to chemical space similar to the training data or by their high computational cost and difficulty of execution (e.g., physics-based approaches). Deep-learning based methods have more recently emerged that bring new speed to this task, but still lag behind physics-based approaches for accuracy.\n\nIsoDDE surpasses all deep-learning methods by a considerable margin on three public benchmarks - FEP+ 4, OpenFE, and the recent CASP16 blind binding affinity prediction task.\n\nIn fact, remarkably, IsoDDE can surpass the performance of physics-based methods such as FEP, despite the fact that these require grounding in experimental crystal structures and IsoDDE does not.\n\nBy delivering highly accurate binding affinity predictions at speed, IsoDDE allows researchers to rapidly rank and optimise potential molecules across diverse chemical series during drug design programs.\n\n## Expanding the Ligandable Proteome\n\nThe ability to identify all of the potential pockets on a protein, in the *absence* of a known ligand, unlocks a number of unique opportunities. Whether dealing with a first-in-class drug discovery target lacking structural annotation or pursuing a novel way to modulate a well-studied protein, a general pocket identification capability can be used to reveal the full set of possible mechanisms of action to pursue for molecular design.\n\nIsoDDE exhibits the capability to identify novel, ligandable pockets even in the absence of a known ligand and far from the model\u2019s training set. This capacity for \u2018blind\u2019 pocket identification demonstrates performance levels approaching experimental techniques like fragment-soaking which require large investments in time, significant cost and real-world experimental work. In comparison, IsoDDE runs on a computer in a matter of seconds.\n\nWe can see the power of this capability in the example of cereblon - a substrate receptor for the CRL4 E3 ligase complex - which plays a key role in tagging damaged or misfolded proteins for proteasomal degradation. For the last 15 years, it was believed that there was one principal way to drug cereblon: through the classic thalidomide-binding pocket. However, a recent study ([Dippon et al. 2026](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09994-w)) experimentally discovered a novel binding pocket that was both allosteric (away from the traditional binding site) and cryptic (hidden in the absence of a binding ligand).\n\nIsoDDE was able to recapitulate the discovery of this pocket, predicting the location of both the known and the novel cryptic sites using only the sequence of cereblon as input, without specifying the identity of the ligands. Further, once the ligands were specified, IsoDDE was able to correctly fold them into their respective pockets in the correct orientation.\n\n## Advancing Drug Discovery\n\nIsoDDE represents a leap forward in accuracy and capability, bringing deeper understanding to the molecular machines that make up the human body, and advancing the process of designing drugs to modulate them.\n\nOur dedicated drug design teams at Isomorphic Labs are using these capabilities every day across our programs \u2013 to understand unseen structures, identify uncharacterised pockets, and create novel chemical matter in the pursuit of new medicines for patients.\n\nWe look forward to continuing to push the frontiers of *in silico* drug design and bringing our new, more powerful capabilities to bear on historically challenging drug targets.\n\n*We thank our friends at Google DeepMind for productive discussions and collaboration.*\n\nRelated\n\n\u00a9 2026 ISOMORPHIC LABS\n\n[Home](/)[Life at Iso](/life-at-iso)[Our Team](/our-team)[Work With Us](/work-with-us)[Our Tech](/our-tech)[Job Openings](/job-openings)[Partnerships](/partnerships)[News](/news)\n\nCONTACT\u00a0US\n\n[Privacy Notice](/privacy-notice)[Cookie Notice](/cookie-notice)[Terms & Conditions](/terms-and-conditions)[Supplier Code of Conduct](/supplier-code-of-conduct)[Manage Cookies](#)\n\n[... 531 more lines.

Composed of long, unique chains of amino acids, they precisely fold into a 3D structure that largely defines the protein\u2019s function - making knowledge of this shape critical for drug discovery and understanding disease.\n\nIf a protein misfolds, it can lose its function and lead to disease, like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s. For decades, determining these structures was a monumental task, often taking a year or more of expensive, painstaking experimental work.\n\nAt the CASP 14 (Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction) competition in 2020, AlphaFold 2 predicted the structures of proteins based just on their amino acid sequences with astonishing accuracy - an achievement widely hailed as a solution to this 50-year-old grand challenge in biology. But the true, lasting impact of this breakthrough came when we put AlphaFold in the hands of the research community.\n\n## A global engine for discovery\n\nIn 2021, we launched the [AlphaFold Protein Database](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/?utm_source=deepmind.google&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=gdm&utm_content=) in partnership with [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/), which was a tipping point toward AlphaFold becoming a scientific tool adopted around the world. And one year later, we released AlphaFold 2\u2019s predictions for more than 200 million protein structures, achieving what would take hundreds of millions of years to solve experimentally.\n\nThe freely available AlphaFold Protein Database has accelerated science on a scale that was previously unimaginable. It has been used by over 3 million researchers in more than 190 countries, including over 1 million users in low- and middle-income countries. Over 30% of AlphaFold-related research is focused on better understanding disease, benefiting human welfare.\n\nThe profound scientific and societal value of this work was recognized in 2024 with the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n\n## Real-world transformation\n\nAlphaFold has become a standard tool for scientists tackling some of the world's most pressing issues, from conservation to heart health.\n\n### Breeding healthier and stronger honeybees\n\nScientists in Europe used AlphaFold to understand a key immunity protein in honeybees, Vitellogenin (Vg). These structural insights are now being applied to conservation efforts for endangered bee populations and guiding the development of AI-assisted breeding programs for healthier, more resilient pollinators.\n\n[Learn more](/blog/breeding-healthier-and-stronger-honeybees/)\n\n### Revealing a key protein behind heart disease\n\nAtherosclerosis, caused by \u201cbad cholesterol\u201d (LDL), is the leading cause of global mortality. For decades, the structure of the central protein in LDL, apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100), remained elusive. AlphaFold 2 helped finally reveal its complex, cage-like shape. This long-awaited blueprint gives pharmaceutical researchers the atomic-level detail needed to design new preventative heart therapies.\n\n[Learn more](/blog/revealing-a-key-protein-behind-heart-disease/)\n\n[Read more about AlphaFold\u2019s impact](/science/alphafold/)\n\n## Revolutionizing Research\n\nAlphaFold is also transforming scientific research - broadening access, accelerating timelines and dramatically lowering the cost.\n\n### Expanding access\n\nTurkish undergraduate students Alper and Taner Karag\u00f6l taught themselves structural biology during the pandemic using [online AlphaFold tutorials](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/alphafold/?utm_source=deepmind.google&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=gdm&utm_content=) \u2013 with no prior training. They've now published 15 research papers.\n\n### Increasing speed of discovery\n\nCyril Zipfel, professor of Molecular & Cellular Plant Physiology at the University of Zurich and Sainsbury Lab, saw research timelines shrink drastically. They used AlphaFold alongside comparative genomics to better understand how plants perceive changes in their environment, paving the way for more resilient crops.\n\nAlphaFold has been cited in more than 35,000 papers and more than 200,000 papers incorporated elements of AlphaFold 2 in their methodology. It\u2019s also enhancing the quality of work being produced.\n\nAn [independent analysis](https://www.innovationgrowthlab.org/resources/ai-in-science-alphafold-2) of AlphaFold 2\u2019s impact, carried out by the Innovation Growth Lab, suggests that researchers using AlphaFold 2 see an increase of over 40% in their submission of novel experimental protein structures. Those protein structures are more likely to be dissimilar to known structures, encouraging the exploration of uncharted areas of science. Also, research linked to AlphaFold 2 is twice as likely to be cited in clinical articles, and is significantly more likely to be cited by a patent, than typical works in structural biology.\n\n## A new era of digital biology\n\nOne of the most exciting examples of AlphaFold's impact is [Isomorphic Labs](https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/) \u2013 an AI drug discovery company founded in 2021 when the breakthrough model proved to be powerful enough to be applied to rational drug design. Isomorphic Labs has since developed a unified drug design engine to dramatically change how it designs new medicines and speed up scientific discovery with an ambition to one day solve all diseases.\n\nTogether with Isomorphic Labs, we developed [AlphaFold 3](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-deepmind-isomorphic-alphafold-3-ai-model/?utm_source=deepmind.google&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=gdm&utm_content=), which offers an unprecedented view into cells that we expect to drive a transformation of the drug discovery process and usher in an era of \"digital biology.\"\n\nThe model is designed to predict the structure and interactions of all of life's molecules \u2014 not just proteins, but DNA, RNA, and ligands (the small molecules that make up most drugs). It can also generate the joint 3D structures of entire molecular complexes, allowing a holistic view of how a potential drug molecule binds to its target protein, or how proteins interact with genetic material.\n\nThe [AlphaFold Server](https://alphafoldserver.com/welcome) is empowering non-commercial researchers globally to harness this technology, accelerating their ability to formulate and test new hypotheses. So far, it\u2019s helped make more than 8 million folds - predictions of structures and interactions - for thousands of researchers around the world.\n\n## The future of AI for science\n\nInspired by AlphaFold, we\u2019ve developed a new generation of models to solve problems across biology. [AlphaMissense](https://deepmind.google/blog/a-catalogue-of-genetic-mutations-to-help-pinpoint-the-cause-of-diseases/) and [AlphaGenome](https://deepmind.google/blog/alphagenome-ai-for-better-understanding-the-genome/) use AI to assess the genetic mutations that underpin disease. Our [AlphaProteo](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphaproteo-generates-novel-proteins-for-biology-and-health-research/) model can design novel, high-strength protein binders that target diverse molecules \u2013 including those associated with cancer and diabetes. These models are deepening our understanding of complex diseases and ultimately driving the development of new treatments.\n\nBiology was our first frontier, but we view AlphaFold as the template for how AI can accelerate all of science to digital speed. From [fusion](https://deepmind.google/blog/bringing-ai-to-the-next-generation-of-fusion-energy/) and [Earth sciences](https://deepmind.google/blog/alphaearth-foundations-helps-map-our-planet-in-unprecedented-detail/) to [scientific discovery](https://deepmind.google/blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/) as a whole, we\u2019re pursuing the next AlphaFold-like breakthroughs. We\u2019re excited to continue partnering with the global scientific community, empowering researchers everywhere to tackle the biggest challenges facing humanity.\n\n[Visit our AlphaFold page](/science/alphafold/) [Explore the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/?utm_source=deepmind.google&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=gdm&utm_content=) [Access the AlphaFold Server](https://alphafoldserver.com/welcome) [Listen to our podcast with John Jumper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pGs0btGmgY)\n\n### Related posts\n\n### AlphaGenome: AI for better understanding the genome\n\nScience\n\n[Learn more](/blog/alphagenome-ai-for-better-understanding-the-genome/)\n\n### AlphaProteo generates novel proteins for biology and health research\n\nScience\n\n[Learn more](/blog/alphaproteo-generates-novel-proteins-for-biology-and-health-research/)\n\n### A glimpse of the next generation of AlphaFold\n\nScience\n\n[Learn more](/blog/a-glimpse-of-the-next-generation-of-alphafold/)\n\n### A catalogue of genetic mutations to help pinpoint the cause of diseases\n\nScience\n\n[Learn more](/blog/a-catalogue-of-genetic-mutations-to-help-pinpoint-the-cause-of-diseases/)\n\n### AlphaFold reveals the structure of the protein universe\n\nScience\n\n[Learn more](/blog/alphafold-reveals-the-structure-of-the-protein-universe/)\n\n### AlphaFold: a solution to a 50-year-old grand challenge in biology\n\nScience\n\n[Learn more](/blog/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology/)\n\n \n\nTitle: How does AlphaFold 3 work?\nURL: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/alphafold/alphafold-3-and-alphafold-server/introducing-alphafold-3/how-does-alphafold-3-work/\nContent: undefined\nRaw Content: How does AlphaFold 3 work? | AlphaFold\n===============\n\n[Edit](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/node/6682)\n\n\u00d7\n\nSearch all of EMBL-EBI \n\n*   [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/)\n*   [Search](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/alphafold/alphafold-3-and-alphafold-server/introducing-alphafold-3/how-does-alphafold-3-work/#)\n*   [About us](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about)\n*   [Training](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training)\n*   [Research](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research)\n*   [Services](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/services)\n*   [EMBL-EBI home](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/)\n\n*   [EMBL-EBI Training](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training)\n*   [On-demand training](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/on-demand)\n*   [online_tutorial](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/on-demand?facets=type:online_tutorial)\n*    AlphaFold \n\n[My learning](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/user)\n\n[My playlists](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/playlists)\n\n[My account](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/user/account)\n\n[Contact us](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/support/training)\n\n[... 231 more lines.

does AlphaFold 3 work?\n==========================\n\nBeta\n\nGot questions? Feel free to ask [Ada](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/ada), our training AI assistant.\n\nAlphaFold 3 is built on similar general principles as AlphaFold 2 (for more on AlphaFold 2, see section [AlphaFold 2: A high-level overview](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/alphafold/inputs-and-outputs/a-high-level-overview/)).\n\nMany practical details remain the same, notably the use of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) as the main input of the neural network. Furthermore, the overall architecture of AlphaFold 3 retains a familiar structure, that of AlphaFold 2, where a large trunk processes a pairwise representation of the chemical complex, which is then used by a structure module to generate explicit atomic positions.\n\nHowever, despite these foundational similarities, AlphaFold 3\u2019s architecture has substantially improved over AlphaFold 2. The new architecture accommodates more general chemical structures and improves the data efficiency of learning.\n\n![Image 2](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/alphafold/wp-content/uploads/sites/259/2025/06/AFS-Education-Figure-2-240828-r01-1024x265.png)\n\nFigure 35. The architecture of AlphaFold 3. Rectangles represent processing modules, while arrows show the flow of data. Yellow, input data; blue, abstract network activations; green, output data. The coloured spheres represent physical atom coordinates.\n\nFor instance, to reduce the amount of MSA processing, AlphaFold 3 replaces AlphaFold 2\u2019s Evoformer with a new Pairformer module that has a smaller and simpler MSA embedding block. Some of AlphaFold 3\u2019s advancements, notably its improved performance predictions of antigen-antibody complexes, are directly related to its reduced dependence on the MSA signal. Nevertheless, for protein structure prediction, AlphaFold 3 still makes heavy use of co-evolutionary data from the MSA.\n\nCrucially, AlphaFold 3 predicts the coordinates of individual atoms within a complex. This is distinct from AlphaFold 2, which predicted the positions of amino acid residues and their side chains. The new approach gives AlphaFold 3 the computational flexibility to tackle different types of molecules.\n\n### Tokenisation\n\nA further change in AlphaFold 3, compared to AlphaFold 2, is how the system subdivides a complex. Both divide the complex of interest into \u201ctokens\u201d. In AlphaFold 2, tokens directly correspond to amino acids, reflecting the system\u2019s strict focus on protein structures. In contrast, AlphaFold 3 is designed to effectively model chemically different molecules, ranging from ions and small molecule ligands to macromolecules made of hundreds of amino acids or nucleotides. A one-token-per-atom approach for the whole structure, including proteins and nucleic acids, would offer the maximum flexibility: however, memory constraints necessitate a compromise.\n\nThus, AlphaFold 3\u2019s tokenisation strategy balances the need for flexibility required for small molecules with computational practicality. Hence, a token may correspond to:\n\n*   One standard amino acid in the protein chain\n*   One standard nucleotide in the nucleic acid chain\n*   One atom of a ligand\n*   One atom of an ion\n*   One atom of a chemically-modified amino acid residue or nucleotide. In order to predict the structure of a chemically-modified amino acid residue or nucleotide, AlphaFold 3 will tokenise the entire residue/nucleotide as atoms. In other words, these are treated more like ligands than standard amino acids or nucleotides.\n\nTo understand this, consider a structure made of 100 amino acid residues and a ligand containing 20 atoms. AlphaFold 3 will represent this structure using 100 + 20 = 120 tokens. This is important because confidence metrics like PAE (see subsection \u201c[Interpreting results from AlphaFold Server](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/alphafold/interpreting-results-from-alphafold-server/)\u201c) are now calculated for tokens rather than amino acids.\n\n![Image 3](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/alphafold/wp-content/uploads/sites/259/2025/06/tokens.png)\n\nFigure 36. Illustrating tokenisation. Here, three amino acid residues take three tokens to model; three nucleotides take three tokens as well, and one citric acid takes 13 tokens, for 13 non-hydrogen atoms in this ligand. \n\n### Diffusion\n\nAlphaFold 3 predicts raw atom coordinates using a diffusion module, making it a \u201cgenerative\u201d ML model. Generative models create new data similar to the examples they learn from: in the case of AlphaFold 3, structures from the Protein Data Bank. This contrasts with non-generative models like AlphaFold 2, which identify patterns in the existing data.\n\nDiffusion is a standard technique in machine learning. First, a high-information dataset is distorted by varying levels of random noise; subsequently, the neural network learns to restore it to the original data. The system uses a conditioning description for each example that should be restored. For example, when generating images, a typical conditioning might be a text description of the final image. During training, the network learns to generate plausible data to fit any given conditioning by incrementally stepping from pure noise to the final output.\n\nIn AlphaFold 3, the diffusion module was trained to receive \u201cnoised\u201d atomic coordinates and predict the correct coordinates. The conditioning information is the sequence information for the target molecule or complex.\n\nFor more details on the internal mechanics of AlphaFold 3, see the Supplementary Material to the AlphaFold 3 paper ([Abramson et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07487-w)).\n\nOverview of AlphaFold 3 outputs\n-------------------------------\n\nAlphaFold 3 outputs the predicted structure of a protein or complex, returning the coordinates of all atoms in the mmCIF format. By default, AlphaFold 3 produces five predicted structures from a single seed. These are generated by sampling the diffusion process five times.\n\nAs with AlphaFold 2, AlphaFold 3 supplies multiple confidence metrics to help you critically assess its predictions:\n\n*   **Predicted LDDT (pLDDT):**predicted atomic coordinates are accompanied by pLDDT scores. These reflect AlphaFold 3\u2019s local confidence in the prediction of the position of that particular atom.\n\n[... 81 more lines.

{"type": "response", "content": "# Latest Advances in Protein Folding Since AlphaFold 3\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nSince the release of AlphaFold 3 in 2024, the field of protein folding has experienced substantial advances driven by new AI models, deeper integration with drug discovery, and innovations in generative protein design. Recent breakthroughs include improved modeling of complex biomolecular structures (beyond proteins), enhanced predictive accuracy in protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions, and the emergence of novel AI-driven drug design engines that surpass AlphaFold 3 in specific benchmarks.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Landscape After AlphaFold 3\n\n**AlphaFold 3 Capabilities and Impact**\n- AlphaFold 3 significantly expanded the prediction scope beyond proteins to include nucleic acids (RNA/DNA), small molecules, ligands, ions, and full molecular complexes, thanks to architectural improvements like the \"Pairformer\" module and atom-centric modeling. This flexibility revolutionizes drug discovery and the design of new molecules [1][2][3].\n- AlphaFold 3 predicts atom-level coordinates via a generative diffusion module, enabling it to model static structures of complex systems, including antibody-antigen and protein-ligand assemblies [2][3].\n- The model made structure prediction more accessible with public servers, benefiting millions of researchers and accelerating science globally [3][6].\n\n**Continued Value of AlphaFold 2**\n- AlphaFold 2 remains relevant: recent community innovation (massive sampling, drop-out at inference) boosts its performance (especially for multimers and antibody-antigen complexes) and it serves in integrated drug-design pipelines alongside newer models [2].\n\n---\n\n## 2. Emerging Solutions Beyond AlphaFold 3\n\n**AI-driven Models and Generative Design**\n- Numerous AI solutions now compete or build upon AlphaFold\u2019s foundation, including EvoBind, ESMFold, RoseTTAFold All-Atom, and RFDiffusion. These offer unique capabilities in de novo protein design, molecular binding, and complex assemblies, enabling tasks such as creating new enzymes, antibodies, and protein drugs [1][2][5].\n- Large \"protein language models\"\u2014analogous to LLMs for text\u2014can generate novel protein sequences with desired functions. These models are easier to tune and democratize custom protein design [5].\n\n**Isomorphic Labs Drug Design Engine (IsoDDE)**\n- Developed by Isomorphic Labs, IsoDDE is a next-generation computational engine for drug design. It:\n  - More than doubles AlphaFold 3\u2019s accuracy in generalizing to novel protein\u2013ligand structures (tested on challenging benchmarks).\n  - Greatly outperforms AlphaFold 3 for predicting antibody\u2013antigen interfaces and small-molecule binding affinities\u2014surpassing even physics-based approaches for binding.\n  - Can identify novel \u201ccryptic\u201d binding pockets and tackle induced fit scenarios, which are vital for rational drug discovery [4].\n- IsoDDE exemplifies the trend: from just folding prediction to actionable insights that directly accelerate lead optimization and design of new therapeutics, even in \u201cunseen\u201d regions of chemical space [4].\n\n**Practical and Structural Trends**\n- Integrating AI-based structure prediction with molecular dynamics and physics-based simulations yields dynamic insights, not just static folds [2].\n- Community workflow improvements (cloud access, GPU acceleration, parallel sampling) further speed and democratize protein engineering [2].\n- AI\u2013driven approaches extend to non-protein molecules and entire molecular complexes, including DNA/RNA, which is transformative for synthetic biology and multi-modal biological research [3][5].\n\n---\n\n## 3. Limitations and Ongoing Research\n\n- **Shortcomings of AlphaFold 3:** struggles with chiral molecules, may generate atomic \u201cclashes\u201d in large proteins, and fundamentally produces static (not dynamic) predictions\u2014so downstream physics simulations remain necessary [2][3].\n- **Benchmarking:** While proprietary and open third-party models are pushing the boundary, peer-reviewed benchmarks and fully open implementations are still catching up [2][4].\n- **Generalization:** Even state-of-the-art models may struggle to generalize to structures highly dissimilar from their training set\u2014a challenge the new IsoDDE system specifically addresses [4].\n\n---\n\n## Conclusions\n\n- Since AlphaFold 3, protein folding research has shifted from solving static protein shapes to deeply integrating AI for actionable, systems-level molecular design and drug discovery.\n- New AI engines such as IsoDDE, generative protein design tools, and protein language models are powering breakthroughs in rational drug design and synthetic biology.\n- The future will likely bring even tighter integration of generative models, physics-based validation, and accessible platforms, democratizing molecular discovery and enabling faster cycles from idea to therapeutic candidate.\n\n## References\n\n[1] Yuktika Malhotra et al., \"Advancements in protein structure prediction: A comparative overview of AlphaFold and its derivatives,\" Comput Biol Med, 2025.
