Whilst AlphaFold 3 delivered a dramatic leap in performance from previous generations of structure prediction models, a key challenge remained: understanding biomolecular structures alone was not sufficient for unlocking real-world drug discovery programs in silico (on a computer). [...] Benchmarks have subsequently revealed that there remained a gap in accuracy for structures that were dissimilar to the examples AlphaFold 3 had been trained on. In other words, that it can struggle to generalise to unexplored regions of biomolecular space where some of the biggest challenges and opportunities in drug discovery lie.\n\nIsoDDE demonstrates a step change in the ability to generalise to protein-ligand structures that are highly dissimilar to those in its training set.\n\nOn the 'Runs N' Poses' benchmark (\u0160krinjar et al. 2025) - designed specifically to test generalisation to novel pockets and ligands - IsoDDE more than doubles the accuracy of AlphaFold 3 on the most difficult systems. [...] We demonstrate that our IsoDDE more than doubles the accuracy of AlphaFold 3 on a challenging protein-ligand structure prediction generalisation benchmark, predicts small molecule binding-affinities with accuracies that exceed gold-standard physics-based methods at a fraction of the time and cost, and is able to accurately identify novel binding pockets on target proteins using only the amino acid sequence as input.\n\nIsoDDE offers a scalable foundation for AI drug design, providing the predictive fidelity required to navigate novel biological systems with unprecedented accuracy.\n\nTitle: The Protein Folding Problem: The day AI unlocked a secret of life\nURL: https://medicine.iu.edu/blogs/research-updates/the-protein-folding-problem-the-day-ai-unlocked-a-secret-of-life\nContent: Comparing its performance to the top team from four years earlier illustrates the progress made. While Baker's team scored a maximum of around 80 points in 2014, AlphaFold achieved an accuracy close to 120 points in 2018. This signifies a substantial leap in the field of protein structure prediction.  \n  \nHow could AlphaFold achieve such remarkable results? Everyone at the competition waited for the AlphaFold team to reveal their experimental model, and the AlphaFold team explained their approach this way (Senior et al., 2020).\n\nFigure 7 [...] 3.

The higher the value on the vertical axis (SUM Z-score), the more accurate the prediction. As shown, even the leading teams achieved limited success, around 75 points, while most teams scored below 25 points, indicating low accuracy. These results demonstrate the considerable challenge of accurately predicting protein structures at the time.   \n  \nGoogle DeepMind's AlphaFold made its debut four years later, in 2018, during the CASP13 competition. The results graph indicates that AlphaFold's prediction accuracy was markedly superior, at a level completely different from before.\n\nAlphaFold shows much higher accuracy than Dr. Baker's group in 2014.\n\nTitle: AlphaFold Changed Science. After 5 Years, It's Still Evolving | WIRED\nURL: https://www.wired.com/story/alphafold-changed-science-after-5-years-its-still-evolving/\nContent: We focus on what I call \u201croot node problems,\u201d areas where the scientific community agrees solutions would be transformative, but where conventional approaches won't get us there in the next five to 10 years. Think of it like a tree of knowledge\u2014if you solve these root problems, you unlock entire new branches of research. Protein folding was definitely one of those.\n\nLooking ahead, I see three key areas of opportunity: building more powerful models that can truly reason and collaborate with scientists like a research partner, getting these tools into the hands of every scientist on the planet, and tackling even bolder ambitions, like creating the first accurate simulation of a complete human cell. [...] We've always been problem-first in our approach. We don't look for places to slot in existing techniques; we understand the problem deeply, then build whatever's needed to solve it. The shift to diffusion models in AlphaFold 3 came from what the science demanded: We needed to predict how proteins, DNA, RNA, and small molecules all interact together, not just individual protein structures. [...] Its work culminated in the compilation of a database that now contains over 200 million predicted structures, essentially the entire known protein universe, and is used by nearly 3.5 million researchers in 190 countries around the world. The Nature article published in 2021 describing the algorithm has been cited 40,000 times to date. Last year, AlphaFold 3 arrived, extending the capabilities of artificial intelligence to DNA, RNA, and drugs. That transition is not without challenges\u2014such as \u201cstructural hallucinations\u201d in the disordered regions of proteins\u2014but it marks a step toward the future.\n\nTo understand what the next five years holds for AlphaFold, WIRED spoke with Pushmeet Kohli, vice president of research at DeepMind and architect of its AI \u200b\u200bfor Science division.\n\nTitle: AlphaFold: Five Years of Impact - Google DeepMind\nURL: https://deepmind.google/blog/alphafold-five-years-of-impact/\nContent: ### Breeding healthier and stronger honeybees\n\nScientists in Europe used AlphaFold to understand a key immunity protein in honeybees, Vitellogenin (Vg). These structural insights are now being applied to conservation efforts for endangered bee populations and guiding the development of AI-assisted breeding programs for healthier, more resilient pollinators.\n\nA highly magnified 3D scientific rendering of a large, textured orange and yellow spherical particle.

A puzzle at the heart of understanding life and curing disease. Then, five years ago, the AlphaFold team cracked the code.\n\n## Real-world transformation\n\nAlphaFold has become a standard tool for scientists tackling some of the world's most pressing issues, from conservation to heart health.\n\n### Breeding healthier and stronger honeybees [...] This picture shows a water-soluble version of the EAAT1 protein. EAAT1 is a transporter in brain cells that normally sits in the membrane and helps clear the neurotransmitter glutamate. Here, the protein has been redesigned using the QTY method, which swaps water-repelling amino acids with water-friendly ones so it can dissolve in water. The blue coils are the protein, and the surrounding dots are water molecules and salt ions.\n\n### Increasing speed of discovery\n\nCyril Zipfel, professor of Molecular & Cellular Plant Physiology at the University of Zurich and Sainsbury Lab, saw research timelines shrink drastically. They used AlphaFold alongside comparative genomics to better understand how plants perceive changes in their environment, paving the way for more resilient crops.\n\nTitle: Emerging frontiers in protein structure prediction following the ... - PMC\nURL: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11999738/\nContent: Repurposing of AlphaFold from protein monomers to PPIs came within months of the original release. The next generation of deep-learning tools for structural predictions of interactions with non-proteins have arrived three years after the initial AlphaFold release; however, we do not believe that these have reached general utility yet. Unlike for PPIs, the co-evolutionary signal within MSAs effectively becomes \u2018one-sided\u2019 when protein\u2013nucleic acid and protein\u2013small molecule interactions are considered. While template structures can be used to guide structure predictions for protein\u2013nucleic acid and other interactions, their requirement limits generalizability. For protein monomers and PPIs, templates are frequently dispensable with AlphaFold, highlighting the general utility for these [...] ## 3. Classes of protein structure prediction\n\nThe uses of AlphaFold have rapidly extended far beyond its initial target of single conformations of native, monomeric proteins. In this section, we discuss these advancements, focusing on how robust and widely applicable they are, and where further improvements may arise. We begin with extensions still involving protein monomers: prediction of conformational changes and mutant proteins. We then consider predictions involving multiple components: protein\u2013protein, protein\u2013nucleic acid and protein\u2013small molecules.\n\n### 3.1. Prediction of multiple conformations [...] The culmination of all these advancements occurred in CASP14 when AlphaFold2 (AF2) from the DeepMind team predicted structures of most of the novel targets with accuracies approaching experimental uncertainty [36,37]. AF2 made several key advances, including using an end-to-end deep neural network that simultaneously processes co-evolutionary information through a specialized transformer (Evoformer) and amino acid geometry through a structural module. AF2 also incorporated the use of homologous structures from the PDB as templates to initialize residue\u2013residue contacts; however, these templates may have a minor effect on the quality of the predictions, particularly for sequences with deep MSAs and in many instances templates can be ignored.\n\nTitle: AlphaFold \u2014 Google DeepMind\nURL: https://deepmind.google/science/alphafold/\nContent: Made from long chains of amino acids, each has a unique complex 3D structure. But figuring out just one of these can take several years, and hundreds of thousands of dollars. In 2020, AlphaFold solved this problem, with the ability to predict protein structures in minutes, to a remarkable degree of accuracy.\n\nThat\u2019s helping researchers understand what individual proteins do and how they interact with other molecules. So valuable time and resources can be redirected into advancing research that could help solve society\u2019s biggest medical and environmental challenges.\n\n### Timeline of a breakthrough\n\n#### In November 2020, AlphaFold was recognised as a solution to the 50-year \u201cprotein-folding problem\u201d.\n\n### AlphaGo\u2019s success proves AI\u2019s readiness to tackle protein folding [...] DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo program defeats legendary Go player Lee Sae Dol in a challenge match in Seoul. This watershed moment demonstrated that DeepMind\u2019s AI techniques were potentially advanced enough to be applied to scientific challenges. A small team is established to start working on protein structure prediction.\n\n### AlphaFold places first at CASP13\n\nAlphaFold\u2019s performance is benchmarked in the 13th Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP13), placing first in the rankings (under entry A7D). The methods are subsequently published in the scientific journal Nature. The team is expanded, and work begins on an innovative new system.\n\n### AlphaFold is recognised as a solution to the protein folding problem at CASP14 [...] ### Understanding the faulty proteins linked to cancer and autism\n\n### Creating plastic-eating enzymes that could save us from pollution\n\n### Advancing discovery of better drugs and medicine\n\n### The race to cure a billion people from a deadly parasitic disease\n\n### Accelerating the race against antibiotic resistance\n\n### AlphaFold unlocks one of the greatest puzzles in biology\n\nAlphaFold has allowed us to take our project to the next level, from a fundamental science stage to the preclinical and clinical development stage.\n\n## Powered by AlphaFold 3 \u2014 AlphaFold Server predicts how proteins will interact with other molecules throughout cells.\n\n### Try AlphaFold\n\n#### A powerful suite of tools, helping the scientific community advance research.\n\n### AlphaFold Protein Structure Database\n\nTitle: AlphaFold\u2014for predicting protein structures - Lasker Foundation\nURL: https://laskerfoundation.org/winners/alphafold-a-technology-for-predicting-protein-structures/\nContent: Since AlphaFold\u2019s release, we have been thrilled by what the scientific community has done with it. To date it has been used by over a million researchers to advance a huge and diverse range of work, everything from enzyme design to disease understanding to drug discovery. The speed with which AlphaFold has been adopted by the biological community as a standard research tool has been very gratifying to see \u2013 it is everything we hoped for and more, and hopefully just the beginning of the impact it will make. [...] ### Bringing AI into the fold\n\nBy 2018 and the 13th CASP competition, scientists had introduced machine learning into their prediction schemes. In contrast to traditional AI approaches that rely on pre-conceived logic, machine-learning systems discover patterns for themselves from data. By making machine learning the central component of their protein-structure prediction network, Hassabis and Jumper\u2019s team won CASP13 with a hefty lead in accuracy over the runner-up and almost a 50% improvement since the best of CASP12. Despite this success, the DeepMind researchers were unsatisfied: They wanted a tool that experimentalists would find useful, with errors of less than one angstrom, the size of an atom. [...] By letting their imaginations and talents fly, Hassabis, Jumper, and their team completed a quest that had flummoxed scientists for half a century. This triumph has launched a new era in studying and manipulating proteins. It has already catalyzed substantial advances, and its impact and reach promise to explode as workers in a vast range of fields dream up new ways to mine its potential.\n\nby Evelyn Strauss\n\nBar graph\n\nTitle: How AI Revolutionized Protein Science, but Didn't End It\nURL: https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-ai-revolutionized-protein-science-but-didnt-end-it-20240626/\nContent: Under Jumper\u2019s leadership, AlphaFold was reconstructed. DeepMind designed a new type of transformer architecture \u2014 a type of deep learning that has \u201cpowered basically every single machine learning breakthrough that\u2019s happened in the last five years,\u201d Townshend said. The neural network tweaked the strength of its connections to create more accurate representations of the data, in this case protein evolutionary and structure data. It ran that data through a second transformer to predict the 3D structure of a protein. The algorithm then honed the structure further by running it, together with some of the revised data, back through its transformers a few more times.\n\nMark Belan for Quanta Magazine [...] RoseTTAFold wasn\u2019t alone. Other AlphaFold competitors, including Meta, crafted their own algorithms to address protein structure prediction or related problems. Some, including Townshend\u2019s biotech startup Atomic AI, have expanded beyond proteins to use deep learning to understand RNA structures. However, in the realm of single-structure predictions, no one has been able to match AlphaFold\u2019s accuracy so far, Thornton said. \u201cI\u2019m sure they will, but I think getting another \u2026 AlphaFold moment like that will be very difficult.\u201d\n\nDavid Baker stands at a podium. [...] Protein design is essentially the \u201cinverse protein folding problem,\u201d said Baker, who directs the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington. Rather than feed an amino acid sequence to a deep learning algorithm and ask it to spit out a protein structure, a protein designer feeds a structure into an algorithm and asks it to spit out a sequence. Then, using that amino acid sequence, the designer builds the protein in the lab.\n\nAlphaFold and RoseTTAFold by themselves can\u2019t spit out these sequences; they are programmed to do the opposite.

Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold.

Here we describe our AlphaFold\u20093 model with a substantially updated diffusion-based architecture that is capable of predicting the joint structure of complexes including proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, ions and modified residues. The new AlphaFold model demonstrates substantially improved accuracy over many previous specialized tools: far greater accuracy for protein\u2013ligand interactions compared with state-of-the-art docking tools, much higher accuracy for protein\u2013nucleic acid interactions compared with nucleic-acid-specific predictors and substantially higher antibody\u2013antigen prediction accuracy compared with AlphaFold-Multimer v.2.3[7](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR7 \"Evans, R. et al.

Almost immediately after AlphaFold became available, it was shown that simple input modifications would enable surprisingly accurate protein interaction predictions[13](#ref-CR13 \"Bryant, P., Pozzati, G. & Elofsson, A.

In all but one category, it achieves a substantially higher performance than strong methods that specialize in just the given task (Fig. [1c](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig1) and Extended Data Table [1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Tab1)), including higher accuracy at protein structure and the structure of protein\u2013protein interactions.\n\nThis is achieved by a substantial evolution of the AF2 architecture and training procedure (Fig. [1d](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig1)) both to accommodate more general chemical structures and to improve the data efficiency of learning. The system reduces the amount of multiple-sequence alignment (MSA) processing by replacing the AF2 evoformer with the simpler pairformer module (Fig. [2a](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig2)). Furthermore it directly predicts the raw atom coordinates with a diffusion module, replacing the AF2 structure module that operated on amino-acid-specific frames and side-chain torsion angles (Fig. [2b](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig2)). The multiscale nature of the diffusion process (low noise levels induce the network to improve local structure) also enable us to eliminate stereochemical losses and most special handling of bonding patterns in the network, easily accommodating arbitrary chemical components.\n\n## Network architecture and training\n\nThe overall structure of AF3 (Fig. [1d](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig1) and Supplementary Methods\u00a0[3](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)) echoes that of AF2, with a large trunk evolving a pairwise representation of the chemical complex followed by a structure module that uses the pairwise representation to generate explicit atomic positions, but there are large differences in each major component. These modifications were driven both by the need to accommodate a wide range of chemical entities without excessive special casing and by observations of AF2 performance with different modifications. Within the trunk, MSA processing is substantially de-emphasized, with a much smaller and simpler MSA embedding block (Supplementary Methods\u00a0[3.3](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)). Compared with the original evoformer from AF2, the number of blocks is reduced to four, the processing of the MSA representation uses an inexpensive pair-weighted averaging and only the pair representation is used for later processing steps. The \u2018pairformer\u2019 (Fig. [2a](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig2) and Supplementary Methods\u00a0[3.6](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)) replaces the evoformer of AF2 as the dominant processing block. It operates only on the pair representation and the single representation; the MSA representation is not retained and all information passes through the pair representation. The pair processing and the number of blocks (48) is largely unchanged from AF2. The resulting pair and single representation together with the input representation are passed to the new diffusion module (Fig. [2b](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig2)) that replaces the structure module of AF2.\n\nThe diffusion module (Fig. [2b](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig2) and Supplementary Methods\u00a0[3.7](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)) operates directly on raw atom coordinates, and on a coarse abstract token representation, without rotational frames or any equivariant processing. We had observed in AF2 that removing most of the complexity of the structure module had only a modest effect on the prediction accuracy, and maintaining the backbone frame and side-chain torsion representation add quite a bit of complexity for general molecular graphs. Similarly AF2 required carefully tuned stereochemical violation penalties during training to enforce chemical plausibility of the resulting structures. We use a relatively standard diffusion approach[33](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR33 \"Karras, T., Aittala, M., Aila, T. & Laine, S. Elucidating the design space of diffusion-based generative models. Adv. Neural Inf. Process. Syst. 35, 26565\u201326577 (2022).\") in which the diffusion model is trained to receive \u2018noised\u2019 atomic coordinates and then predict the true coordinates. This task requires the network to learn protein structure at a variety of length scales, whereby the denoising task at small noise emphasizes understanding very local stereochemistry and the denoising task at high noise emphasizes the large-scale structure of the system. At the inference time, random noise is sampled and then recurrently denoised to produce a final structure. Importantly, this is a generative training procedure that produces a distribution of answers. This means that, for each answer, the local structure will be sharply defined (for example, side-chain bond geometry) even when the network is uncertain about the positions. For this reason, we are able to avoid both torsion-based parametrizations of the residues and violation losses on the structure, while handling the full complexity of general ligands. Similarly to some recent work[34](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR34 \"Wang, Y., Elhag, A. A., Jaitly, N., Susskind, J. M. & Bautista, M. A. Generating molecular conformer fields. Preprint at arXiv \n                  https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2311.17932\n                  \n                 (2023).\"), we find that no invariance or equivariance with respect to global rotations and translation of the molecule are required in the architecture and we therefore omit them to simplify the machine learning architecture.\n\nThe use of a generative diffusion approach comes with some technical challenges that we needed to address. The biggest issue is that generative models are prone to hallucination[35](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR35 \"Ji, Z., et al. Survey of hallucination in natural language generation. ACM Comput. Surv. 55, 248 (2023).\"), whereby the model may invent plausible-looking structure even in unstructured regions. To counteract this effect, we use a cross-distillation method in which we enrich the training data with structures predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer (v.2.3)[7](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR7 \"Evans, R. et al. Protein complex prediction with AlphaFold-Multimer. Preprint at bioRxiv \n                  https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.04.463034\n                  \n                 (2022).\"),[8](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR8 \"\u017didek, A. AlphaFold v.2.3.0 Technical Note. GitHub \n                  https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold/blob/main/docs/technical_note_v2.3.0.md\n                  \n                 (2022).\"). In these structures, unstructured regions are typically represented by long extended loops instead of compact structures, and training on them \u2018teaches\u2019 AF3 to mimic this behaviour. This cross-distillation greatly reduced the hallucination behaviour of AF3 (Extended Data Fig. [1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig6) for disorder prediction results on the CAID 2[36](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR36 \"Del Conte, A. et al. Critical assessment of protein intrinsic disorder prediction (CAID)\u2014results of round 2. Proteins 91, 1925\u20131934 (2023).\") benchmark set).\n\nWe also developed confidence measures that predict the atom-level and pairwise errors in our final structures. In AF2, this was done directly by regressing the error in the output of the structure module during training. However, this procedure is not applicable to diffusion training, as only a single step of the diffusion is trained instead of a full-structure generation (Fig. [2c](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig2)). To remedy this, we developed a diffusion \u2018rollout\u2019 procedure for the full-structure prediction generation during training (using a larger step size than normal; Fig. [2c](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig2) (mini-rollout)). This predicted structure is then used to permute the symmetric ground-truth chains and ligands, and to compute the performance metrics to train the confidence head. The confidence head uses the pairwise representation to predict a modified local distance difference test (pLDDT) and a predicted aligned error (PAE) matrix as in AF2, as well as a distance error matrix (PDE), which is the error in the distance matrix of the predicted structure as compared to the true structure (details are provided in Supplementary Methods\u00a0[4.3](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)).\n\nFigure [2d](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig2) shows that, during initial training, the model learns quickly to predict the local structures (all intrachain metrics go up quickly and reach 97% of the maximum performance within the first 20,000 training steps), while the model needs considerably longer to learn the global constellation (the interface metrics go up slowly and protein\u2013protein interface LDDT passes the 97% bar only after 60,000 steps). During AF3 development, we observed that some model abilities topped out relatively early and started to decline (most likely due to overfitting to the limited number of training samples for this capability), while other abilities were still undertrained. We addressed this by increasing or decreasing the sampling probability for the corresponding training sets (Supplementary Methods\u00a0[2.5.1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)) and by performing early stopping using a weighted average of all of the above metrics and some additional metrics to select the best model checkpoint (Supplementary Table [7](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)). The fine-tuning stages with the larger crop sizes improve the model on all metrics with an especially high uplift on protein\u2013protein interfaces (Extended Data Fig. [2](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig7)).\n\n## Accuracy across complex types\n\nAF3 can predict structures from input polymer sequences, residue modifications and ligand SMILES\u00a0(simplified molecular-input line-entry system). In Fig. [3](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig3) we show a selection of examples highlighting the ability of the model to generalize to a number of biologically important and therapeutically relevant modalities. In selecting these examples, we considered novelty in terms of the similarity of individual chains and interfaces to the training set (additional information is provided in Supplementary Methods\u00a0[8.1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)).\n\nWe evaluated the performance of the system on recent interface-specific benchmarks for each complex type (Fig. [1c](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig1) and Extended Data Table [1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Tab1)). Performance on protein\u2013ligand interfaces was evaluated on the PoseBusters benchmark set, which is composed of 428 protein\u2013ligand structures released to the PDB in 2021 or later. As our standard training cut-off date is in 2021, we trained a separate AF3 model with an earlier training-set cutoff ([Methods](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Sec7)). Accuracy on the PoseBusters set is reported as the percentage of protein\u2013ligand pairs with pocket-aligned ligand root mean squared deviation (r.m.s.d.) of less than 2\u2009\u00c5. The baseline models come in two categories: those that use only protein sequence and ligand SMILES as an input and those that additionally leak information from the solved protein\u2013ligand test structure. Traditional docking methods use the latter privileged information, even though that information would not be available in real-world use cases. Even so, AF3 greatly outperforms classical docking tools such as Vina[37](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR37 \"Trott, O. & Olson, A. J. AutoDock Vina: improving the speed and accuracy of docking with a new scoring function, efficient optimization, and multithreading. J. Comput. Chem. 31, 455\u2013461 (2010).\"),[38](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR38 \"Miller, E. B. et al. Reliable and accurate solution to the induced fit docking problem for protein\u2013ligand binding.

Theory Comput. \n                  https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00136\n                  \n                 (2021).\") even while not using any structural inputs (Fisher\u2019s exact test, *P*\u2009=\u20092.27\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221213) and greatly outperforms all other true blind docking like RoseTTAFold All-Atom (*P*\u2009=\u20094.45\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221225). Extended Data Fig. [3](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig8) shows three examples in which AF3 achieves accurate predictions but docking tools Vina and Gold do not[37](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR37 \"Trott, O. & Olson, A. J. AutoDock Vina: improving the speed and accuracy of docking with a new scoring function, efficient optimization, and multithreading. J. Comput. Chem. 31, 455\u2013461 (2010).\"). PoseBusters analysis was performed using a training cut-off of 30 September 2019 for AF3 to ensure that the model was not trained on any PoseBusters structures. To compare with the RoseTTAFold All-Atom results, we used PoseBusters version 1. Version 2 (crystal contacts removed from the benchmark set) results including quality metrics are shown in Extended Data Fig. [4b\u2013f](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig9) and Extended Data Table [1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Tab1). We use multiple seeds to ensure correct chirality and avoid slight protein\u2013ligand clashing (as opposed to a method like diffusion guidance to enforce) but we are typically able to produce high-quality stereochemistry. Separately, we also train a version of AF3 that receives the \u2018pocket information\u2019 as used in some recent deep-learning work[24](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR24 \"Liao, Z. et al.

As RoseTTAFold2NA is validated only on structures below 1,000 residues, we use only structures below 1,000 residues from our recent PDB evaluation set for this comparison ([Methods](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Sec7)). AF3 is able to predict protein\u2013nucleic structures with thousands of residues, an example of which is shown in Fig. [3a](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig3). Note that we do not compare directly to RoseTTAFold All-Atom, but benchmarks indicate that RoseTTAFold All-Atom is slightly less accurate than RoseTTAFold2NA for nucleic acid predictions[29](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR29 \"Krishna, R. et al. Generalized biomolecular modeling and design with RoseTTAFold All-Atom. Science 384, eadl2528 (2024).\").\n\nWe also evaluated AF3 performance on the ten publicly available Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction 15 (CASP15) RNA targets: we achieve a higher average performance than RoseTTAFold2NA and AIchemy\\_RNA[27](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR27 \"Shen, T. et al.

We did not reach the performance of the best human-expert-aided CASP15 submission AIchemy\\_RNA2[39](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR39 \"Chen, K., Zhou, Y., Wang, S. & Xiong, P.

Owing to limited dataset sizes, we do not report significance test statistics here. Further analysis of the accuracy of predicting nucleic acids alone (without proteins) is shown in Extended Data Fig. [5b](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig10).\n\nCovalent modifications (bonded ligands, glycosylation, and modified protein residues and nucleic acid bases) are also accurately predicted by AF3 (Fig. [1c](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig1) (centre right)). Modifications include those to any polymer residue (protein, RNA or DNA). We report accuracy as the percentage of successful predictions (pocket r.m.s.d. <\u20092\u2009\u00c5). We apply quality filters to the bonded ligands and glycosylation dataset (as does PoseBusters): we include only ligands with high-quality experimental data (ranking\\_model\\_fit\u2009>\u20090.5, according to the RCSB structure validation report, that is, X-ray structures with a model quality above the median). As with the PoseBusters set, the bonded ligands and glycosylation datasets are not filtered by homology to the training dataset. Filtering on the basis of the bound polymer chain homology (using polymer template similarity\u2009<\u200940) yielded only five clusters for bonded ligands and seven clusters for glycosylation. We exclude multi-residue glycans here because the RCSB validation report does not provide a ranking\\_model\\_fit value for them. The percentage of successful predictions (pocket r.m.s.d.\u2009<\u20092\u2009\u00c5) for multi-residue glycans on all-quality experimental data is 42.1% (*n*\u2009=\u2009131 clusters), which is slightly lower than the success rate for single-residue glycans on all-quality experimental data of 46.1% (*n*\u2009=\u2009167). The modified residues dataset is filtered similarly to our other polymer test sets: it contains only modified residues in polymer chains with low homology to the training set ([Methods](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Sec7)). See Extended Data Table [1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Tab1) for detailed results, and Extended Data Fig. [6](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig11) for examples of predicted protein, DNA and RNA structures with covalent modifications, including analysis of the impact of phosphorylation on predictions.\n\nWhile expanding in modelling abilities, AF3 has also improved in protein complex accuracy relative to AlphaFold-Multimer (v.2.3)[7](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR7 \"Evans, R. et al. Protein complex prediction with AlphaFold-Multimer.

Generally, protein\u2013protein prediction success (DockQ\u2009>\u20090.23)[40](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR40 \"Basu, S. & Wallner, B. DockQ: a quality measure for protein-protein docking models. PLoS ONE 11, e0161879 (2016).\") has increased (paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test, *P*\u2009=\u20091.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221218), with antibody\u2013protein interaction prediction in particular showing a marked improvement (Fig. [1c](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig1) (right); paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test, *P*\u2009=\u20096.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22125, predictions top-ranked from 1,000 rather than the typical 5 seeds; further details are provided in Fig. [5a](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig5)). Protein monomer LDDT improvement is also significant (paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test, *P*\u2009=\u20091.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221234). AF3 has a very similar dependence on MSA depth to AlphaFold-Multimer v.2.3; proteins with shallow MSAs are predicted with lower accuracy (a comparison of the dependence of single-chain LDDT on MSA depth is shown in Extended Data Fig. [7a](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig12)).\n\n## Predicted confidences track accuracy\n\nAs with AF2, AF3 confidence measures are well calibrated with accuracy. Our confidence analysis is performed on the recent PDB evaluation set, with no homology filtering and including peptides. The ligands category is filtered to high-quality experimental structures as described above, and considers standard non-bonded ligands only. See Extended Data Fig. [8](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig13) for a similar assessment on bonded ligand and other interfaces. All statistics are cluster-weighted ([Methods](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Sec7)) and consider the top-ranked prediction only (ranking details are provided in Supplementary Methods\u00a0[5.9.3](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)).\n\nIn Fig. [4a](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig4) (top row), we plot the chain pair interface-predicted TM (ipTM) score[41](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR41 \"Zhang, Y. & Skolnick, J. Scoring function for automated assessment of protein structure template quality. Proteins 57, 702\u2013710 (2004).\") (Supplementary Methods\u00a0[5.9.1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)) against interface accuracy measures: protein\u2013protein DockQ, protein\u2013nucleic interface LDDT (iLDDT) and protein\u2013ligand success, with success defined as the percentage of examples under thresholded pocket-aligned r.m.s.d. values. In Fig. [4a](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig4) (bottom row), we plot the average pLDDT per protein, nucleotide or ligand entity against our bespoke LDDT\\_to\\_polymer metric (metrics details are provided in the\u00a0[Methods](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Sec7)), which is closely related to the training target of the pLDDT predictor.\n\nIn Fig. [4b\u2013e](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig4), we highlight a single example prediction of [7T82](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb7T82/pdb), in which per-atom pLDDT colouring identifies unconfident chain tails, somewhat confident interfaces and otherwise confident secondary structure. In Fig. [4c](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig4), the same prediction is coloured by chain, along with DockQ interface scores in Fig. [4d](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig4) and per-chain colouring displayed on the axes for reference. We see from Fig. [4e](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig4) that PAE confidence is high for pink\u2013grey and blue\u2013orange residue pairs for which DockQ\u2009>\u20090.7, and least confident about pink\u2013orange and pink\u2013blue residue pairs that have DockQ\u2009\u2248\u20090. A similar PAE analysis of an example with protein and nucleic acid chains is shown in Extended Data Fig. [5c,d](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig10).\n\n## Model limitations\n\nWe note model limitations of AF3 with respect to stereochemistry, hallucinations, dynamics and accuracy for certain targets.\n\nOn stereochemistry, we note two main classes of violations. The first is that the model outputs do not always respect chirality (Fig. [5b](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig5)), despite the model receiving reference structures with correct chirality as input features. To address this in the PoseBusters benchmark, we included a penalty for chirality violation in our ranking formula for model predictions. Despite this, we still observe a chirality violation rate of 4.4% in the benchmark. The second class of stereochemical violations is a tendency of the model to occasionally produce overlapping (clashing) atoms in the predictions. This sometimes manifests as extreme violations in homomers in which entire chains have been observed to overlap (Fig. [5e](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig5)). Penalizing clashes during ranking (Supplementary Methods\u00a0[5.9.3](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)) reduces the occurrence of this failure mode but does not eliminate them. Almost all remaining clashes occur for protein\u2013nucleic complexes with both greater than 100 nucleotides and greater than 2,000 residues in total.\n\nWe note that the switch from the non-generative AF2 model to the diffusion-based AF3 model introduces the challenge of spurious structural order (hallucinations) in disordered regions (Fig. [5d](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig5) and Extended Data Fig. [1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig6)). Although hallucinated regions are typically marked as very low confidence, they can lack the distinctive ribbon-like appearance that AF2 produces in disordered regions. To encourage ribbon-like predictions in AF3, we use distillation training from AF2 predictions, and we add a ranking term to encourage results with more solvent accessible surface area[36](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR36 \"Del Conte, A. et al. Critical assessment of protein intrinsic disorder prediction (CAID)\u2014results of round 2. Proteins 91, 1925\u20131934 (2023).\").\n\nA key limitation of protein structure prediction models is that they typically predict static structures as seen in the PDB, not the dynamical behaviour of biomolecular systems in solution. This limitation persists for AF3, in which multiple random seeds for either the diffusion head or the overall network do not produce an approximation of the solution ensemble.\n\nIn some cases, the modelled conformational state may not be correct or comprehensive given the specified ligands and other inputs. For example, E3 ubiquitin ligases natively adopt an open conformation in an apo state and have been observed only in a closed state when bound to ligands, but AF3 exclusively predicts the closed state for both holo and apo systems[42](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR42 \"Watson, E. R. et al. Molecular glue CELMoD compounds are regulators of cereblon conformation. Science 378, 549\u2013553 (2022).\") (Fig. [5c](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig5)). Many methods have been developed, particularly around MSA resampling, that assist in generating diversity from previous AlphaFold models[43](#ref-CR43 \"Wayment-Steele, H. K. et al. Predicting multiple conformations via sequence clustering and AlphaFold2. Nature 625, 832\u2013839 (2024).\"),[44](#ref-CR44 \"del Alamo, D., Sala, D., Mchaourab, H. S. & Meiler, J. Sampling alternative conformational states of transporters and receptors with AlphaFold2. eLife \n                  https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.75751\n                  \n                 (2022).\"),[45](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR45 \"Heo, L. & Feig, M. Multi-state modeling of G-protein coupled receptors at experimental accuracy. Proteins 90, 1873\u20131885 (2022).\") and may also assist in multistate prediction with AF3.\n\nDespite the large advance in modelling accuracy in AF3, there are still many targets for which accurate modelling can be challenging. To obtain the highest accuracy, it may be necessary to generate a large number of predictions and rank them, which incurs an extra computational cost. A class of targets in which we observe this effect strongly is antibody\u2013antigen complexes, similar to other recent work[46](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR46 \"Wallner, B. AFsample: improving multimer prediction with AlphaFold using massive sampling. Bioinformatics 39, btad573 (2023).\"). Figure [5a](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig5) shows that, for AF3, top-ranked predictions keep improving with more model seeds, even at as many as 1,000 (Wilcoxon signed-rank test between 5 and 1,000 seeds, *P*\u2009=\u20092.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22125 for percentage correct and *P*\u2009=\u20090.009 for percentage very high accuracy; ranking by protein\u2013protein interface ipTM). This large improvement with many seeds is not observed in general for other classes of molecules (Extended Data Fig. [7b](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig12)). Using only one diffusion sample per model seed for the AF3 predictions rather than five (not illustrated) does not change the results significantly, indicating that running more model seeds is necessary for antibody score improvements, rather than just more diffusion samples.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe core challenge of molecular biology is to understand and ultimately regulate the complex atomic interactions of biological systems. The AF3 model takes a large step in this direction, demonstrating that it is possible to accurately predict the structure of a wide range of biomolecular systems in a unified framework. Although there are still substantial challenges to achieve highly accurate predictions across all interaction types, we demonstrate that it is possible to build a deep-learning system that shows strong coverage and generalization for all of these interactions. We also demonstrate that the lack of cross-entity evolutionary information is not a substantial blocker to progress in predicting these interactions and, moreover, substantial improvement in antibody results suggests AlphaFold-derived methods are able to model the chemistry and physics of classes of molecular interactions without dependence on MSAs. Finally, the large improvement in protein\u2013ligand structure prediction shows that it is possible to handle the wide diversity of chemical space within a general deep-learning framework and without resorting to an artificial separation between protein structure prediction and ligand docking.\n\nThe development of bottom-up modelling of cellular components is a key step in unravelling the complexity of molecular regulation within the cell, and the performance of AF3 shows that developing the right deep-learning frameworks can massively reduce the amount of data required to obtain biologically relevant performance on these tasks and amplify the impact of the data already collected. We expect that structural modelling will continue to improve not only due to advances in deep learning but also because continuing methodological advances in experimental structure determination, such as the substantial improvements in cryo-electron microscopy and tomography, will provide a wealth of new training data to further the improve the generalization ability of such models. The parallel developments of experimental and computational methods promise to propel us further into an era of structurally informed biological understanding and therapeutic development.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Full algorithm details\n\nExtensive explanations of the components are available in Supplementary Methods\u00a0[2](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)\u2013[5](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1). Moreover, pseudocode is available in Supplementary Algorithms\u00a0[1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)\u2013[31](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1), network diagrams in Figs. [1d](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig1) and \u00a0[2a\u2013c](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig2) and Supplementary Fig. [2](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1), input features in Supplementary Table [5](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1) and additional hyperparameters for training in Supplementary Tables [3](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1), [4](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1) and [7](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1).\n\n### Training regime\n\nNo structural data used during training were released after 30 September 2021 and, for the model used in PoseBusters evaluations, we filtered out PDB[32](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR32 \"Berman, H. M. et al. The Protein Data Bank. Nucleic Acids Res. 28, 235\u2013242 (2000).\") structures released after 30 September 2021. One optimizer step uses a mini batch of 256 input data samples and during initial training 256\u2009\u00d7\u200948\u2009=\u200912,288 diffusion samples. For fine-tuning, the number of diffusion samples is reduced to 256\u2009\u00d7\u200932 = 8,192. The model is trained in three stages\u2014the initial training with a crop size of 384 tokens and two sequential fine tuning stages with crop sizes of\u00a0640 and 768 tokens. Further details are provided in Supplementary Methods\u00a0[5.2](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1).\n\n### Inference regime\n\nNo inference time templates or reference ligand position features were released after 30 September 2021, and in the case of PoseBusters evaluation, an earlier cut-off date of 30 September 2019 was used. The model can be run with different random seeds to generate alternative results, with a batch of diffusion samples per seed. Unless otherwise stated, all results are generated by selecting the top confidence sample from running 5 seeds of the same trained model, with 5 diffusion samples per model seed, for a total of 25 samples to choose from. Standard crystallization aids are excluded from predictions (Supplementary Table [8](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)).\n\nResults are shown for the top-ranked sample and sample ranking depends on whether trying to select the overall best output globally, or the best output for some chain, interface or modified residue. Global ranking uses a mix of pTM and ipTM along with terms to reduce cases with large numbers of clashes and increase rates of disorder; individual chain ranking uses a chain specific pTM measure; interface ranking uses a bespoke ipTM measure for the relevant chain pair; and modified residue ranking uses average pLDDT over the residue of interest (Supplementary Methods\u00a0[5.9.3](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)).\n\n### Metrics\n\nEvaluation compares a predicted structure to the corresponding ground-truth structure. If the complex contains multiple identical entities, assignment of the predicted units to the ground-truth units is found by maximizing LDDT. Assignment in local symmetry groups of atoms in ligands is solved by exhaustive search over the first 1,000 per-residue symmetries as given by RDKit.\n\nWe measure the quality of the predictions with DockQ, LDDT or pocket-aligned r.m.s.d. For nucleic\u2013protein interfaces, we measure interface accuracy through iLDDT, which is calculated from distances between atoms across different chains in the interface. DockQ and iLDDT are highly correlated (Extended Data Fig. [9](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig14)), so the standard cut-offs for DockQ can be translated to equivalent iLDDT cut-offs. Nucleic acid LDDTs (intrachains and interface) were calculated with an inclusion radius of 30\u2009\u00c5 compared with the usual 15\u2009\u00c5 used for proteins, owing to their larger scale. For confidence calibration assessment, we use a bespoke LDDT (LDDT\\_to\\_polymer) metric that considers differences from each atom of a given entity to any C\u03b1 or C1\u2032 polymer atom within its inclusion radius. This is closely related to how the confidence prediction is trained (Supplementary Methods\u00a0[4.3.1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)).\n\nPocket-aligned r.m.s.d. is computed as follows: the pocket is defined as all heavy atoms within 10\u2009\u00c5 of any heavy atom of the ligand, restricted to the primary polymer chain for the ligand or modified residue being scored, and further restricted to only backbone atoms for proteins. The primary polymer chain is defined variously: for PoseBusters, it is the protein chain with the most atoms within 10\u2009\u00c5 of the ligand; for bonded ligand scores, it is the bonded polymer chain; and for modified residues, it is the chain in which the residue is contained (minus that residue). The pocket is used to align the predicted structure to the ground-truth structure with least-squares rigid alignment and then the r.m.s.d. is computed on all heavy atoms of the ligand.\n\n### Recent PDB evaluation set\n\nGeneral model evaluation was performed on our recent PDB set consisting of 8,856 PDB complexes released between 1 May 2022 and 12 January 2023. The set contains almost all PDB complexes released during that period that are less than 5,120 model tokens in size (Supplementary Methods\u00a0[6.1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)). Single chains and interfaces within each structure were scored separately rather than only looking at full complex scores, and clustering was then applied to chains and interfaces so that scores could be aggregated first within clusters and then across clusters for mean scores, or using a weighting of inverse cluster size for distributional statistics (Supplementary Methods\u00a0[6.2](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1) and [6.4](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)).\n\nEvaluation on ligands excludes standard crystallization aids (Supplementary Table [8](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)), our ligand exclusion list (Supplementary Table [9](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)) and glycans (Supplementary Table [10](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)). Bonded and non-bonded ligands are evaluated separately. Ions are only included when specifically mentioned (Supplementary Table [11](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)).\n\nThe recent PDB set is filtered to a low homology subset (Supplementary Methods\u00a0[6.1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)) for some results where stated. Homology is defined as sequence identity to sequences in the training set and is measured by template search (Supplementary Methods\u00a0[2.4](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)). Individual polymer chains in evaluation complexes are filtered out if the maximum sequence identity to chains in the training set is greater than 40%, where sequence identity is the percentage of residues in the evaluation set chain that are identical to the training set chain. Individual peptide chains (protein chains with less than 16 residues) are always filtered out. For polymer\u2013polymer interfaces, if both polymers have greater than 40% sequence identity to two chains in the same complex in the training set, then the interface is filtered out. For interfaces to a peptide, the interface is filtered out if the non-peptide entity has greater than 40% sequence identity to any chain in the training set.\n\nTo compare the quality of prediction of protein\u2013protein interfaces and protein monomers against that of AlphaFold-Multimer\u00a0(v.2.3)[8](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR8 \"\u017didek, A. AlphaFold v.2.3.0 Technical Note. GitHub \n                  https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold/blob/main/docs/technical_note_v2.3.0.md\n                  \n                 (2022).\"), and to compare the dependence of single-protein-chain prediction quality on MSA depth, we restrict the low-homology recent PDB set to complexes with fewer than 20 protein chains and fewer than 2,560 tokens. We compare against unrelaxed AlphaFold-Multimer v.2.3 predictions.\n\nTo study antibody-antigen interface prediction, we filter the low homology recent PDB set to complexes that contain at least one protein\u2013protein interface where one of the protein chains is in one of the two largest PDB chain clusters (these clusters are representative of antibodies). We further filter to complexes with at most 2,560 tokens and with no unknown amino acids in the PDB to allow extensive comparison against relaxed predictions of AlphaFold-Multimer v2.3. That leaves 71 antibody\u2013antigen complexes, containing 166 antibody\u2013antigen interfaces spanning 65 interface clusters.\n\nMSA depth analysis (Extended Data Fig. [7a](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig12)) was based on computing the normalized number of effective sequences (*N*eff) for each position of a query sequence. Per-residue *N*eff values were obtained by counting the number of non-gap residues in the MSA for this position and weighting the sequences using the *N*eff scheme[49](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR49 \"Wu, T., Hou, J., Adhikari, B. & Cheng, J. Analysis of several key factors influencing deep learning-based inter-residue contact prediction. Bioinformatics 36, 1091\u20131098 (2020).\") with a threshold of 80% sequence identity measured on the region that is non-gap in either sequence.\n\n### Nucleic acid prediction baseline\n\nFor benchmarking performance on nucleic acid structure prediction, we report baseline comparisons to an existing machine learning system for protein\u2013nucleic acid and RNA tertiary structure prediction, RoseTTAFold2NA[18](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR18 \"Baek, M. et al. Accurate prediction of protein\u2013nucleic acid complexes using RoseTTAFoldNA. Nat. Methods 21, 117\u2013121 (2024).\"). We run the open source RF2NA[50](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR50 \"DiMaio, F. RF2NA v.0.2. GitHub \n                  https://github.com/uw-ipd/RoseTTAFold2NA/releases/tag/v0.2\n                  \n                 (2023).\") with the same MSAs as those that were used for AF3 predictions. For comparison between AF3 and RF2NA, a subset of our recent PDB set was chosen to meet the RF2NA criteria (<1,000 total residues and nucleotides). As RF2NA was not trained to predict systems with DNA and RNA, analysis is limited to targets with only one nucleic acid type. No system was publicly available at time of writing for baseline comparisons on data with arbitrary combinations of biomolecular types in PDB.\n\nAs an additional baseline for RNA tertiary structure prediction, we evaluate AF3 performance on CASP15 RNA targets that were publicly available\u00a0as of 1 December 2023 (R1116/8S95, R1117/8FZA, R1126 (downloaded from the CASP15 website <https://predictioncenter.org/casp15/TARGETS_PDB/R1126.pdb>), R1128/8BTZ, R1136/7ZJ4, R1138/[7PTK/7PTL], R1189/7YR7 and R1190/7YR6). We compare the top-1 ranked predictions and, where multiple ground-truth structures exist (R1136), the prediction is scored against the closest state. We display comparisons to RF2NA as a representative machine learning system; AIchemy\\_RNA2 as the top performing entrant with human intervention; and AIchemy\\_RNA as the top performing machine learning system. All entrants\u2019 predictions were downloaded from the CASP website and scored internally.\n\n### PoseBusters\n\nWhile other analyses used an AlphaFold model trained on PDB data released before a cut-off of 30 September 2021, our PoseBusters analysis was conducted on a model (with identical architecture and similar training schedule) differing only in the use of an earlier 30 September 2019 cut-off. This analysis therefore did not include training data, inference time templates or \u2018ref\\_pos\u2019 features released after this date.\n\nInference was performed on the asymmetric unit from specified PDBs, with the following minor modifications. In several PDB files, chains clashing with the ligand of interest were removed ([7O1T](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb7O1T/pdb), [7PUV](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb7PUV/pdb), [7SCW](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb7SCW/pdb), [7WJB](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb7WJB/pdb), [7ZXV](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb7ZXV/pdb), [8AIE](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb8AIE/pdb)). Another PDB entry ([8F4J](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb8F4J/pdb)) was too large to inference the entire system (over 5,120 tokens), so we included only protein chains within 20\u2009\u00c5 of the ligand of interest. Five model seeds, each with five diffusion samples, were produced per target, resulting in 25 predictions, which were ranked by quality and predicted accuracy: the ranking score was calculated from an ipTM aggregate (Supplementary Methods\u00a0[5.9.3](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1) (point 3)), then further divided by 100 if the ligand had chirality errors or had clashes with the protein.\n\nFor pocket-aligned r.m.s.d., first alignment between the predicted and ground-truth structures was conducted by aligning to the ground-truth pocket backbone atoms (CA, C or N atoms within 10\u2009\u00c5 of the ligand of interest) from the primary protein chain (the chain with the greatest number of contacts within 10\u2009\u00c5 of the ligand). The PoseBusters Python package v.0.2.7[51](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR51 \"Buttenschoen, M. PoseBusters v.0.2.7. GitHub \n                  https://github.com/maabuu/posebusters/releases/tag/v0.2.7\n                  \n                 (2023).\") was used to score r.m.s.d. and violations from the pocket-aligned predictions.\n\nWhile AlphaFold models are \u2018blind\u2019 to the protein pocket, docking is often performed with knowledge of the protein pocket residues. For example, Uni-Mol specifies the pocket as any residue within 6\u2009\u00c5 of the heavy atoms in the ligand of interest[26](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR26 \"Zhou, G. et al. Uni-Mol: a universal 3D molecular representation learning framework. Preprint at ChemRxiv \n                  https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/6402990d37e01856dc1d1581\n                  \n                 (2023).\"). To evaluate the ability of AF3 to dock ligands accurately when given pocket information, we fine-tuned a 30 September 2019 cut-off AF3 model with an additional token feature specifying pocket\u2013ligand pairs (Supplementary Methods\u00a0[2.8](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)). Specifically, an additional token feature was introduced, set to true for a ligand entity of interest and any pocket residues with heavy atoms within 6\u2009\u00c5 of the ligand entity. At training time, a single random ligand entity is chosen to use in this feature. Note that multiple ligand chains with the same entity (CCD code) may be selected. At inference time, the ligand entity was chosen based on the ligand of interest\u2019s CCD code, so again multiple ligand chains were occasionally chosen. The results of this analysis are shown in Extended Data Fig. [4](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig9).\n\n### Model performance analysis and visualization\n\nData analysis used Python v.3.11.7 (<https://www.python.org/>), NumPy v.1.26.3 (<https://github.com/numpy/numpy>), SciPy v.1.9.3 (<https://www.scipy.org/>), seaborn v.0.12.2 (<https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn>), Matplotlib v.3.6.1 (<https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib>), pandas v.2.0.3 (<https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas>), statsmodels v.0.12.2 (<https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels>), RDKit v.4.3.0 (<https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit>) and Colab (<https://research.google.com/colaboratory>).

We have unlocked a new paradigm of predictive accuracy in understanding our biomolecular world, allowing us to rationally design new medicines on a computer with unprecedented understanding and precision.\n\nWe are giving a glimpse at a subset of the powerful and expansive capabilities of the Isomorphic Labs Drug Design Engine (IsoDDE), a unified computational drug-design system, progressing beyond AlphaFold 3 (AF3) in its predictive accuracy and introducing new capabilities which bridge the gap between structure prediction and real-world drug discovery.\n\nWe demonstrate that our IsoDDE more than doubles the accuracy of AlphaFold 3 on a challenging protein-ligand structure prediction generalisation benchmark, predicts small molecule binding-affinities with accuracies that exceed gold-standard physics-based methods at a fraction of the time and cost, and is able to accurately identify novel binding pockets on target proteins using only the amino acid sequence as input.\n\nIsoDDE offers a scalable foundation for AI drug design, providing the predictive fidelity required to navigate novel biological systems with unprecedented accuracy.\n\nSince our [release of AlphaFold 3](https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/articles/alphafold-3-predicts-the-structure-and-interactions-of-all-of-lifes-molecules) in 2024 together with Google DeepMind, the field of AI drug discovery has moved at an extraordinary pace. Whilst AlphaFold 3 delivered a dramatic leap in performance from previous generations of structure prediction models, a key challenge remained: understanding biomolecular structures alone was not sufficient for unlocking real-world drug discovery programs *in silico* (on a computer).\n\nProgress in rational drug design - vital for solving human disease - requires highly accurate predictive models, across an expansive range of biochemical properties and interactions, that are able to work in concert with one another. Crucially, with so much of biological and chemical space still unexplored, these models need the ability to generalise their predictive power beyond their training sets to novel, unseen systems.\n\nAs we continue to address these challenges, we are excited to introduce the Isomorphic Labs Drug Design Engine (IsoDDE), and to preview a subset of IsoDDE's capabilities below and in our technical report.\n\n[Read Our Technical Report](https://storage.googleapis.com/isomorphiclabs-website-public-artifacts/isodde_technical_report.pdf)\n\n## Structure Prediction of Truly Novel Systems\n\nAccurately predicting the structure of biomolecules and how they interact remains a crucial capability for rational drug design. Many critical downstream tasks are unlocked by being able to accurately model the small nuances in a protein\u2019s geometry - whether understanding the impact of disease-causing mutations, or predicting which molecules will bind to a target protein.\n\nAlphaFold 3 transformed protein-ligand structure prediction at the time of its release and the freely available AlphaFold Protein Database accelerated science on a scale that was previously unimaginable. To date, it has been used by over 3 million researchers in more than 190 countries.\n\nBenchmarks have subsequently revealed that there remained a gap in accuracy for structures that were dissimilar to the examples AlphaFold 3 had been trained on. In other words, that it can struggle to generalise to unexplored regions of biomolecular space where some of the biggest challenges and opportunities in drug discovery lie.\n\nIsoDDE demonstrates a step change in the ability to generalise to protein-ligand structures that are highly dissimilar to those in its training set.\n\nOn the 'Runs N' Poses' benchmark ([\u0160krinjar et al. 2025](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.03.636309v3)) - designed specifically to test generalisation to novel pockets and ligands - IsoDDE more than doubles the accuracy of AlphaFold 3 on the most difficult systems.\n\nIn the report, we demonstrate through several examples that we can successfully model complex, out-of-distribution events such as induced fits (where a protein adapts its shape to accommodate a bound ligand) and the opening of cryptic pockets (those hidden in the absence of a bound ligand) - critical biological mechanisms - even when these systems are distant from the training sets of such models.\n\nIsoDDE is able to successfully predict the structure of a protein-protein interaction inhibitor bound to a cryptic pocket on the NKG2D homo-dimer interface (8EA6) from the lowest 0-20 similarity bin of the Runs\u2019n\u2019Poses test set (AlphaFold 3 fails on this example)\n\n## Opening a New Window for Complex Biologics\n\nBut small molecules (like aspirin) are only one piece of the puzzle. As therapeutic modalities expand toward complex biologics (like insulin), the ability to accurately model antibody-antigen interfaces is paramount.\n\nIsoDDE provides a step change in accuracy for this domain. It outperforms AlphaFold 3 by 2.3x and Boltz-2 by 19.8x in the high-fidelity regime (DockQ > 0.8) on a challenging, novel antibody-antigen test set.\n\nCrucially, IsoDDE shows remarkable performance on the CDR-H3 loop - the most variable and difficult part of an antibody to predict - effectively unlocking new possibilities for *de novo* antibody design.\n\n## A New Gold-Standard for Binding Affinity Prediction\n\nKnowing the 3D structure of a biochemical system is only the first step; effective drug optimisation requires knowing how strongly a molecule will bind to its target.\n\nTraditional approaches are either limited to chemical space similar to the training data or by their high computational cost and difficulty of execution (e.g., physics-based approaches). Deep-learning based methods have more recently emerged that bring new speed to this task, but still lag behind physics-based approaches for accuracy.\n\nIsoDDE surpasses all deep-learning methods by a considerable margin on three public benchmarks - FEP+ 4, OpenFE, and the recent CASP16 blind binding affinity prediction task.\n\nIn fact, remarkably, IsoDDE can surpass the performance of physics-based methods such as FEP, despite the fact that these require grounding in experimental crystal structures and IsoDDE does not.\n\nBy delivering highly accurate binding affinity predictions at speed, IsoDDE allows researchers to rapidly rank and optimise potential molecules across diverse chemical series during drug design programs.\n\n## Expanding the Ligandable Proteome\n\nThe ability to identify all of the potential pockets on a protein, in the *absence* of a known ligand, unlocks a number of unique opportunities. Whether dealing with a first-in-class drug discovery target lacking structural annotation or pursuing a novel way to modulate a well-studied protein, a general pocket identification capability can be used to reveal the full set of possible mechanisms of action to pursue for molecular design.\n\nIsoDDE exhibits the capability to identify novel, ligandable pockets even in the absence of a known ligand and far from the model\u2019s training set. This capacity for \u2018blind\u2019 pocket identification demonstrates performance levels approaching experimental techniques like fragment-soaking which require large investments in time, significant cost and real-world experimental work. In comparison, IsoDDE runs on a computer in a matter of seconds.\n\nWe can see the power of this capability in the example of cereblon - a substrate receptor for the CRL4 E3 ligase complex - which plays a key role in tagging damaged or misfolded proteins for proteasomal degradation. For the last 15 years, it was believed that there was one principal way to drug cereblon: through the classic thalidomide-binding pocket. However, a recent study ([Dippon et al. 2026](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09994-w)) experimentally discovered a novel binding pocket that was both allosteric (away from the traditional binding site) and cryptic (hidden in the absence of a binding ligand).\n\nIsoDDE was able to recapitulate the discovery of this pocket, predicting the location of both the known and the novel cryptic sites using only the sequence of cereblon as input, without specifying the identity of the ligands. Further, once the ligands were specified, IsoDDE was able to correctly fold them into their respective pockets in the correct orientation.\n\n## Advancing Drug Discovery\n\nIsoDDE represents a leap forward in accuracy and capability, bringing deeper understanding to the molecular machines that make up the human body, and advancing the process of designing drugs to modulate them.\n\nOur dedicated drug design teams at Isomorphic Labs are using these capabilities every day across our programs \u2013 to understand unseen structures, identify uncharacterised pockets, and create novel chemical matter in the pursuit of new medicines for patients.\n\nWe look forward to continuing to push the frontiers of *in silico* drug design and bringing our new, more powerful capabilities to bear on historically challenging drug targets.\n\n*We thank our friends at Google DeepMind for productive discussions and collaboration.*\n\nRelated\n\n\u00a9 2026 ISOMORPHIC LABS\n\n[Home](/)[Life at Iso](/life-at-iso)[Our Team](/our-team)[Work With Us](/work-with-us)[Our Tech](/our-tech)[Job Openings](/job-openings)[Partnerships](/partnerships)[News](/news)\n\nCONTACT\u00a0US\n\n[Privacy Notice](/privacy-notice)[Cookie Notice](/cookie-notice)[Terms & Conditions](/terms-and-conditions)[Supplier Code of Conduct](/supplier-code-of-conduct)[Manage Cookies](#)\n\nTitle: Emerging frontiers in protein structure prediction following the ... - PMC\nURL: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11999738/\nContent: undefined\nRaw Content: An official website of the United States government\n\nHere's how you know\n\n**Official websites use .gov**   \n A **.gov** website belongs to an official government organization in the United States.\n\n**Secure .gov websites use HTTPS**   \n A **lock** (  ) or **https://** means you've safely connected to the .gov website.

Current protein structure prediction tools lie at the interface of biology, chemistry and computer science. Millions of protein structure models have been generated in a very short space of time through a revolution in protein structure prediction driven by deep learning, led by AlphaFold. This has provided a wealth of new structural information. Interpreting these predictions is critical to determining where and when this information is useful. But proteins are not static nor do they act alone, and structures of proteins interacting with other proteins and other biomolecules are critical to a complete understanding of their biological function at the molecular level. This review focuses on the application of state-of-the-art protein structure prediction to these advanced applications. We also suggest a set of guidelines for reporting AlphaFold predictions.\n\n**Keywords:** AlphaFold, protein structure prediction, protein\u2013protein interactions, co-evolution, conformational changes, biomolecular interactions\n\n## 1. Protein structure prediction and the build-up to AlphaFold\n\n### 1.1. Fundamental role of protein structures\n\nProteins are polymers of amino acids and are involved in all processes of life, from enzymes that catalyse metabolic reactions, to motors that convert chemical potential energy into mechanical force, to cytoskeletal highways that facilitate transport. The diversity of these functions is achieved by their varied amino acid sequences. Twenty chemically distinct amino acids can be incorporated into linear polymers of hundreds, even thousands of units long. The first experimental protein structures determined in the 1950s and 1960s showed these linear polymers adopt complex folded chains [[1](#B1)]. Strikingly, amino acid residues distal in the sequence can be spatially proximal in the folded structure ([figure 1](#F1)). Despite this complexity, the molecular view of biology that protein structures enable creates a crucial interface at several disciplines. Chemically, structures can provide a basis for enzymatic reactions and help inform rational drug development. Clinically, structures can rationalize patient mutations in amino acid sequences. Experimentally, protein structures can integrate with other methods like mass spectrometry and biochemical assays to provide a more complete understanding of protein function.\n\nAdvances in experimental techniques have led to thousands of atomic models of proteins with distinct folds, highlighting the complexity of this class of biomolecules. Large-scale structural genomics projects have contributed significantly to this expansion of available structures [[2](#B2)]. However, experimental methods remain time-consuming, generally requiring isolation of the protein(s) of interest and using expensive X-ray sources, electron sources or high-field magnets, with extensive optimization required throughout the process. Technological advances have massively reduced the cost to sequence genomes, leading to identification of millions of different protein sequences. This has created a large disparity between the numbers of sequences versus structures that are available, and reliable methods to compute atomic models from amino acid sequences have been a goal for over 50 years.\n\nProteins attain their three-dimensional structure through a folding process, but this is far from straightforward. Even small protein polymers have huge degrees of freedom in their atomic geometry giving rise to vast spaces of potential conformations, yet proteins fold on biological timescales by exploring only a small subset of possible conformations (Levinthal\u2019s paradox) [[3](#B3)]. Furthermore, the folding process is impacted by cellular factors such as (i) chaperones, other proteins that regulate folding [[4](#B4)], or (ii) pauses in translation driven by the RNA sequence encoding the protein [[5](#B5),[6](#B6)], or even (iii) interaction with the ribosome itself [[6](#B6)]. As such the problem of deriving a general protein folding mechanism is not necessarily reducible to the amino acid sequence alone.\n\nProtein structure prediction\u2014the computation of protein structures from amino acid sequences\u2014represents a distinct challenge from a complete understanding of the folding process itself [[7](#B7)]. This does not necessarily require consideration of the folding process and so while a solution to the protein folding problem encompasses a solution to protein structure prediction, the reverse is not necessarily true. The structure prediction field has greatly benefitted from the Critical Assessment of Methods of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP), a biannual competition that rigorously tests different structure prediction approaches [[8](#B8)]. Early CASP competitions recognized two prediction scenarios that reflect the fact that many proteins share similar folds. When experimental structures exist for proteins with similar folds (homologues), these can serve as templates to guide prediction\u2014an approach termed template-based modelling. The more challenging scenario occurs when no such structural homologues are available, requiring \u2018free modelling\u2019 of the structure from sequence alone. CASP\u2019s doubly blinded format, using carefully selected recent experimental structures as targets, provides an excellent framework for validating both approaches. Various methods have been developed to tackle these and other structure prediction tasks; however, we focus on a subset of the free modelling approaches leading to the state-of-the-art prediction tools that have revolutionized structural biology.\n\n### 1.2. The evolution of protein structure prediction\n\nThe goal to predict protein structures from sequences originated shortly after the first experimental structures were determined; however, it took many decades and a convergence of numerous tools and databases to yield methods for general and accurate protein structure prediction ([figure 2](#F2)). The cornerstone of modern protein structure prediction is the concept of amino acid co-evolution [[10](#B10)\u2013[12](#B12)]. In the 1980s, it was appreciated that there is selection pressure to maintain mutually compatible interactions within the protein structure, i.e. protein structure and function constrain the tolerance of the amino acid sequence to mutations [[10](#B10)]. However, it was not until the 1990s that the converse was formally proposed\u2014analysis of mutations that occur naturally can be used to infer protein structure [[11](#B11),[12](#B12)]. The correlations between amino acid positions, known as evolutionary couplings, can be determined by comparison against homologous sequences using multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). These couplings reflect co-evolution of amino acid positions and can be used to infer direct residue\u2013residue contact probabilities, even between residues that are distal in the amino acid sequence.\n\nMultiple methods have been used to extract coupling information from MSAs. Relatively simple correlation metrics were initially used with limited success [[13](#B13)]. This is because indirectly contacting residues can also co-evolve leading to false-positive predicted interactions [[14](#B14)]. To account for this, more advanced statistical analyses were used that distinguish between direct and indirect coupling [[14](#B14)\u2013[19](#B19)]. The potential of this approach was first observed in CASP11 where a target more than 250 amino acid residues long, with many homologous sequences but no homologous structures available, was predicted with good precision [[20](#B20)].\n\nThe final technical advancement came from the application of neural networks to evolutionary coupling and structure prediction [[21](#B21)\u2013[25](#B25)]. Several key developments in this field, particularly regarding deep learning, pushed protein structure prediction into broad practical utility. In 2012, the importance of large networks with many layers for pattern recognition was demonstrated for image classification [[26](#B26)]. In 2017, the transformer deep-learning architecture was introduced, exploiting an attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies in sequences and facilitating massive parallel processing of sequence data [[27](#B27)]. However deep learning still requires a wealth of data to learn patterns, and extensive MSAs are required for each protein that is to be predicted.\n\nAlongside these method developments, databases of protein sequences and structures have expanded by orders of magnitude ([figure 2](#F2)). The first repository of protein sequences was released in the 1960s [[28](#B28)] and since then a number of databases have been established [[29](#B29)\u2013[31](#B31)]. Algorithms to rapidly search these vast sequence databases and assemble MSAs were also developed [[32](#B32)\u2013[34](#B34)]. These developments allow generation of extensive MSAs for many proteins from many species. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) was established in 1971 as a repository of experimentally determined protein structures [[35](#B35)]. This database has grown to over 200\u2009000 structures, although not all are unique proteins. The PDB also holds experimental and model statistics, which allows identification of high-quality models. This database provides an excellent source of information on the geometry amino acids adopt within protein structures. Both sequence and structure databases are critical for the application of deep learning to protein structure prediction.\n\nThe culmination of all these advancements occurred in CASP14 when AlphaFold2 (AF2) from the DeepMind team predicted structures of most of the novel targets with accuracies approaching experimental uncertainty [[36](#B36),[37](#B37)]. AF2 made several key advances, including using an end-to-end deep neural network that simultaneously processes co-evolutionary information through a specialized transformer (Evoformer) and amino acid geometry through a structural module. AF2 also incorporated the use of homologous structures from the PDB as templates to initialize residue\u2013residue contacts; however, these templates may have a minor effect on the quality of the predictions, particularly for sequences with deep MSAs and in many instances templates can be ignored.\n\nIt is worth noting that RoseTTAFold from the Baker group was subsequently developed and produces predictions approaching the accuracy of AF2 [[38](#B38)]. Protein language models have also been utilized to predict protein structures, the most powerful of which has been ESMFold [[39](#B39),[40](#B40)]. These systems do not require MSAs and instead use a single sequence. While AF2 predictions that incorporate MSAs yield better predictions in general [[39](#B39)], for sequences with fewer identifiable homologues that generate shallow MSAs, ESMFold can outperform AF2 [[41](#B41)]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that protein language models have memorized motifs derived from co-evolutionary information [[42](#B42)], underscoring the importance of this information.\n\n### 1.3. Accessibility of AlphaFold\n\nTogether with the release of AF2 code (<https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold>), predictions of proteomes of several well-studied organisms have been made publicly available through the European Bioinformatics Institute and DeepMind teams in the AlphaFold Database (AFDB) [[43](#B43)]. This has since been expanded to over 200 million predictions [[9](#B9)]. Although virus structures were not included in the AFDB, several groups have systematically applied protein structure prediction to viral proteomes ([table 1](#T1)) [[41](#B41),[43](#B43)\u2013[45](#B45)].\n\n#### Table 1.\n\nDatabases of predicted protein structures generated through large-scale computational prediction.\n\n| database | size | species | prediction type | website |\n| AFDB [[9](#B9)] | >214 000 000 | various (excluding viruses) | monomers | <https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/> |\n| Big Fantastic Virus Databases [[44](#B44)] | >351\u2009000 | various viruses | monomers | <https://bfvd.foldseek.com/> |\n| Nomburg *et al*.

A major advance in accessibility of AF2 for bespoke purposes was aided by the MMSeq2 sequence search tool, to facilitate rapid MSA generation [[34](#B34)], and the Google Colab computing environment providing access to GPU compute necessary to run AF2. These are nicely tied together through ColabFold [[51](#B51)].\n\n### 1.4. Impact of AlphaFold\n\nA striking demonstration of the usefulness of structural predictions from state-of-the-art tools is their application to experimental structures. The most definitive example is that subtle errors in experimental structures, where the amino acid sequence in the model is offset from what it should be, known as sequence register errors, can be identified through discrepancies between experimental models and prediction models [[49](#B49)]. In these cases, the prediction frequently provides better local agreement with the experimental data than the human-built model [[50](#B50)]. Predictions can be used as base models to accelerate modelling of experimental structural data [[51](#B51)] and have also been used to solve the phase problem in protein crystallography [[52](#B52)]. The large-scale prediction efforts for viruses have led to the identification of novel protein folds [[44](#B44),[45](#B45)], construction of structure-based virus phylogenies and elucidation of virus-host evolution [[41](#B41)].\n\nThe initial target of AlphaFold was individual protein monomers; however, proteins do not function in isolation; they interact with other proteins, nucleic acids and small molecules. The success of AlphaFold in predicting protein monomers has driven a shift towards structure prediction of these interactions. Protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs) also constrain mutations in protein sequences, i.e. evolutionary couplings can arise between amino acid positions from multiple different proteins. It is not surprising that there was almost immediate interest in applying AF2 to PPIs and within a few months of the initial release of AF2, AF2-multimer was released allowing multiple sequences to be incorporated into a single prediction [[53](#B53)]. For interactions involving two proteins, this is achieved through paired MSAs involving orthologues of protein pairs that facilitate extraction of evolutionary couplings between the proteins [[53](#B53)\u2013[55](#B55)]. Several databases for pairs of interacting proteins have been developed, enhancing the accessibility of PPI predictions ([table 1](#T1)) [[46](#B46)\u2013[48](#B48)]. In addition to modelling PPIs, protein interactions with nucleic acids, small molecules and post-translational modifications are also important targets for structural biology. AlphaFold3 (AF3), Chai-1, Boltz-1 and RosettaFold-All-Atom have been developed to extend predictions to include these molecules and modifications [[56](#B56)\u2013[59](#B59)]. The code for all these models has been made available, and AF3 and Chai-1 have dedicated webservers for running predictions. At the time of writing, the AF3 server allows users 20 predictions per day, each prediction up to 5000 tokens (one token per polymer unit and one token per atom in non-polymers), while the Chai-1 server allows 25 predictions per day, each up to 2048 tokens. Prediction of protein interactions with other proteins and biomolecules is the main focus of this review. However, regardless of whether the prediction is a single protein sequence or multiple biomolecules the predicted models must be examined to ensure they are reasonable which we discuss in the following section.\n\n## 2. Confidence metrics\n\nQuantifying improvements in the accuracy of protein structure prediction algorithms requires metrics to score the similarity between predicted and experimental structures. However, it is well established that single metrics often prove inadequate [[60](#B60)]. Useful predictions may show high structural similarity over a small proportion of the sequence, or lower similarity but over a larger proportion of the sequence [[61](#B61)]. Additionally, many metrics rely on superimposing predicted and experimental structures. As proteins are often modular and exhibit flexibility between domains, optimal superimposition over one domain may be suboptimal for others, lowering the overall accuracy even if the predictions of the individual domains themselves are highly accurate [[62](#B62)]. Consequently, CASP competitions have used a variety of metrics to score predictions to quantify both global and local accuracy. Neural networks trained to predict protein structures are also trained to estimate the accuracy of the predicted models [[63](#B63)]. AlphaFold generates confidence values for each model as well as metrics defined at the residue level. Researchers should consider all of these metrics when evaluating predicted models ([table 2](#T2)).\n\n### Table 2.\n\nConfidence metrics typically used to assess usefulness of AlphaFold predictions.\n\n| metric | model or residue level | description | assessment |\n| pLDDT | residue | confidence of residue modelling | 0\u2212100  >90\u2014sidechains correct  >70\u2014backbone is correct  <50\u2014probably unstructured |\n| PAE | residue | confidence in distance between two residues | 0\u221230 \u00c5  (lower\u2192more confident) |\n| pTM | model | confidence of protein fold | 0\u22121  >0.7\u20130.9 chance of being the correct fold  >0.5\u2014likely the correct fold  <0.2\u2014unlikely to be correctly folded |\n| replicates | both | repeated computations of the predicted model (typically 1\u22125) | replicates should superimpose |\n| chemistry | both | is the region chemically sensible? | hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, clash scores, etc. |\n\n[Open in a new tab](table/T2/)\n\n### 2.1. Predicted local distance difference test\n\nThe local distance difference test (LDDT) score was introduced in CASP9 [[64](#B64)], and provides an alignment free, per-residue score of how well local atomic geometry is preserved when a model is compared with a reference structure. The test examines pairs of atoms within a 15 \u00c5 radius in the reference structure and determines if their distances are maintained in the model structure within specific tolerance thresholds (0.5, 1, 2 and 4 \u00c5). A final LDDT score is calculated as the average fraction of preserved distances across all four thresholds for atom pairs within the 15 \u00c5 radius. The LDDT ranges from 0 to 100, where 100 indicates perfect agreement. AlphaFold generates predicted LDDT (pLDDT) scores as a confidence measure, effectively estimating the reliability of each part of the predicted structure. AF2 considers only C\u03b1 carbon atom distances and therefore has a single pLDDT per residue, while AF3 considers all atoms. Of note, pLDDT scores also provide a useful guide for intrinsically disordered regions in proteins, with low scores (<50) correlating with disordered regions. However, it is important to recognize the atomic structure of the low-confidence region will not be accurately modelled [[63](#B63)].\n\n### 2.2. Predicted Aligned Error\n\nAlphaFold also generates a score for each residue pair within the prediction that reflects the uncertainty in their positioning relative to each other. All the pairings taken together yield a 2D Predicted Aligned Error (PAE) plot. The PAE scores effectively represent the predicted positional error, in angstroms, between the given model and a hypothetical ground truth structure at residue *i*, if the two structures were superimposed on residue *j*. Examples of PAE plots for various levels of predicted structuredness are shown in [figure 3](#F3). For well-defined domains, each residue within the domain is confident with respect to the others, producing characteristic squares of high confidence on the main diagonal of the plot ([figure 3](#F3), left two examples). On the other hand, for disordered proteins only residues adjacent to each other in the amino acid sequence are high confidence, producing a line of confidence along the diagonal ([figure 3](#F3), rightmost example). For predictions of PPIs, the inter-protein confidence scores are important, which are present on the off-diagonal of the PAE plots [[53](#B53)] ([figure 4](#F4)).\n\n### 2.3. Predicted Template Modelling score\n\nPrior to introduction of the Template Modelling (TM) score, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) was used in CASP. RMSD is calculated from two optimally superimposed atomic structures by taking the square root of the mean of the squared distances between corresponding atoms in the two structures [[66](#B66)]. This measure typically considers only C\u03b1 carbon atoms from each residue in the superimposed structures and approaches zero for two identical structures. One shortcoming of using RMSD alone is that a small number of large deviations between the predicted and actual structures can greatly increase the score [[67](#B67)]. This led to the introduction of the TM score in CASP5 [[61](#B61)], in which the deviation between C\u03b1 atom positions appears in the denominator of the equation, and is normalized by the length of the protein. Values range between 0 and 1, with unrelated proteins producing a score of approximately 0.2, while scores above 0.7 represent a 90% probability the proteins have the same fold [[68](#B68)].\n\nThe predicted TM (pTM) score is calculated by approximating the deviation between residues in the predicted structure and corresponding residues in the hypothetical ground-truth structure, instead of using the actual deviation observed in superimposed structures [[37](#B37)]. For PPIs, the interface pTM (ipTM) score specifically evaluates the confidence of predicted interfaces by considering pairs of residues that lie on different protein chains [[53](#B53)]. It should be noted the pTM and ipTM scores are calculated from the predicted positional error probabilities used to calculate PAE values.\n\n### 2.4. Additional measures\n\nIn addition to the confidence metrics provided by AlphaFold, several other criteria can be used. For example, AlphaFold incorporates some diversity in the predicted structures through its ensemble of five neural networks trained with different random seeds and varying template usage. The RMSD of these computational replicates can be used to provide additional assessment of the confidence either at a local level, e.g. between domains, or between the entire models.\n\nThe plausibility of the predicted chemical interactions in the region of interest should also be assessed. Experimental structure validation tools such as MolProbity [[69](#B69)] can be used to give additional model-level metrics of prediction quality, and specify regions where the predicted model deviates from ideal bond geometry or introduces clashes between residues.\n\nFurther support for predicted structures comes from experimentally testing mutations designed based on the predictions. This can also be considered retrospectively. For example, alanine scanning mutagenesis had identified key amino acid residues within a disordered region as critical for a protein\u2013protein interaction ([figure 5](#F5)) [[71](#B71)]. Despite experimental structure determination of the assembly using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM), a reliable model of this region was not able to be constructed [[72](#B72)]. AlphaFold predictions between the two proteins revealed a confident interaction in terms of pLDDT and PAE scores. The predictions were chemically sensible, with a leucine on one protein buried into a hydrophobic pocket of the other, and an adjacent arginine forming an ionic interaction with an aspartate [[70](#B70)]. Strikingly, these two residues were the most critical in the original alanine scanning mutagenesis. Subsequent experimental support for the AlphaFold mode of interaction was obtained by focusing on this region in cryoEM maps [[70](#B70)]. Overall, these data convincingly supported the AlphaFold model ([figure 5](#F5)).\n\n### 2.5. Guidance on AlphaFold confidence metrics\n\nWhile model-level metrics can be used to assess the accuracy of the overall fold, residue-level metrics are typically more useful in experimental design and for flexible and multi-domain proteins. For example, drug design and screening require high confidence in the positioning of active site residues [[73](#B73)], while assessing PPI predictions requires consideration of confidence levels in the residues constituting the interface itself [[53](#B53),[74](#B74)]. The importance of assessing confidence metrics is exemplified in AF3 where extended disordered regions for large proteins can form bundles of helices [[57](#B57)]. These hallucinations may appear to have reasonable folds but their pLDDT scores are low and likely result from the diffusion-based architecture of AF3.\n\nAny publication reporting AlphaFold predictions that are not available in any database should provide:\n\n* (1) pLDDT and PAE confidence metrics\n* (2) Model files\n* (3) Details of the prediction methods\n\nAt a minimum, the confidence metrics should be illustrated in a figure; however, making the associated files available is preferable. The pLDDT and PAE metrics are generated as json or pickle files, while predicted structures are generated as PDB or CIF files, with the pLDDT scores stored in the B-factor column. ModelArchive is a useful repository that allows upload of predicted structures and associated data (<https://modelarchive.org/>). Details of the prediction methods should be included in the publication, and can also be included in ModelArchive, for example, the version of the structure prediction software, which templates were used, and whether Amber relaxation of the model was performed. Although it is not common to include the MSA, this may be useful to compare predictions of the same target that use different MSAs, particularly as sequencing databases change. Considering the correlation between MSA depth and prediction quality, reporting the MSA depth may also be useful to consider. Together this information will provide readers with all the information to critique the predictions.\n\n## 3. Classes of protein structure prediction\n\nThe uses of AlphaFold have rapidly extended far beyond its initial target of single conformations of native, monomeric proteins. In this section, we discuss these advancements, focusing on how robust and widely applicable they are, and where further improvements may arise. We begin with extensions still involving protein monomers: prediction of conformational changes and mutant proteins. We then consider predictions involving multiple components: protein\u2013protein, protein\u2013nucleic acid and protein\u2013small molecules.\n\n### 3.1. Prediction of multiple conformations\n\nProteins are often structurally heterogeneous with conformational changes coupled to function, for example, binding of a ligand or phosphorylation of residues can trigger large conformational changes. There is a continuum of structural heterogeneity. At one extreme are intrinsically disordered regions, such as short linear motifs, which can adopt numerous conformational states. However, there are frequently only two dominant states relating to protein function, for example, open versus closed states of ion channels, auto-inhibited versus activated state of enzymes and pre- and post-fusion conformations of viral fusion proteins. Thermodynamic modelling of proteins as two different functional states can also be applied to intrinsically disordered regions [[75](#B75)]. Prediction of such conformational ensembles was first introduced as a category in CASP15 [[76](#B76)].\n\nAlphaFold has been engineered to predict a single structure, and while it will generally produce a correct conformation, this may be biased towards one state ([figure 6a](#F6)) [[77](#B77)\u2013[79](#B79)]. The balance between number of experimental structures of each conformation in the PDB has shown to be important in determining which conformation AlphaFold favours [[79](#B79)]. However, several approaches have been developed to extract multiple conformations using AlphaFold.\n\nThese approaches have typically focused on manipulation of MSAs [[77](#B77),[78](#B78),[80](#B80)\u2013[84](#B84)]. Reducing the number of residues considered in the MSA by masking columns [[80](#B80)] and limiting depth of the MSA by sub-sampling sequences have both been explored [[77](#B77),[81](#B81)\u2013[83](#B83)]. AF-Cluster groups the sequences of the MSA into subsets to explore predicted conformational space [[82](#B82)] ([figure 6b](#F6)); however, random sequence sampling can also be used [[77](#B77)]. The use of template structures can also influence predicted conformations, particularly in cases with shallow MSAs [[77](#B77)]. Random perturbation when the models are generated has also been performed by dropout of layers of the neural network and can increase diversity in the predictions [[85](#B85)]. An adaptation of AF2, Cfold, has been trained specifically on one set of conformational states with other sets being used for evaluation, and with MSA clustering and dropout of layers to search for different conformations [[84](#B84)]. This structure prediction tool was able to predict some conformational changes outside of the training set but struggled with large conformational changes. Another study suggests that conformational changes may only be able to be robustly generated when the training set contains similar-sized clusters of each conformation [[79](#B79)]. In general, there is some disagreement about the impact of co-evolutionary information versus the training set in predicting alternative conformations [[83](#B83),[86](#B86)\u2013[88](#B88)] and the wider applicability of these approaches remains to be shown.\n\nA more natural approach for protein conformations might be to simultaneously generate two or more predictions from one run ([figure 6c](#F6)). It has been shown that MSAs contain information on protein conformations, where predicted distances between flexible residue pairs tend to have more complex probability landscapes than rigid pairs [[89](#B89),[90](#B90)]. Deriving multiple conformations simultaneously could avoid the need to cluster sequences into subsets and instead use information from all sequences in modelling all conformations. However, this is complicated by the possible presence of structural variation between homologues that can also imprint on MSAs [[91](#B91)]. These would need to be detangled from true conformational changes. Furthermore, training on structures with multiple conformations may be required [[89](#B89)] as well as more experimental structures covering multiple conformations. MultiSFold has been developed with this approach and provides improvements over AlphaFold2, particularly for cases with lower AlphaFold2 confidence metrics [[92](#B92)]. We expect the prediction of conformational changes to advance rapidly in the coming years and become of general utility.\n\n### 3.2. Prediction of mutants and variants\n\nPoint mutations in protein structures are of interest clinically, underlying many genetic diseases and present in cancers. Mutations may cause disease by interfering with enzyme-substrate binding or catalytic mechanisms, which may be evident from the structure alone, or through reducing protein stability. It has been shown that changes in pLDDT confidence scores from AF2 predictions before and after point mutation do not correlate with experimental measurements of protein stability [[93](#B93)]. This is perhaps unsurprising as point mutations will have only a minor effect on the MSA and therefore co-evolutionary information will likely constrain the residue\u2013residue contacts to the wild-type structure. However, the DeepMind team have adapted the AlphaFold system to focus on pathogenicity of point mutations [[94](#B94)]. This involved fine-tuning on variants that were common in humans and primates and assigned to be benign and variants that were absent assigned to be pathogenic. Importantly, AlphaMissense does not predict structural changes due to mutations. However, this is a useful tool when considering the disease relevance of point mutants. Splice variants are another biologically relevant sequence-driven variation in protein structure. However, co-evolutionary information drawn from both canonical and splice variations may confound the structure prediction.\n\nNevertheless, knowledge of the wild-type protein structure can be used to design precise mutations that disrupt specific aspects of a proteins function. In the absence of structural information, a simple approach is to perform a series of truncations to identify important regions for a particular function. However, many proteins fold back upon themselves creating complex relationships between sequence and structure meaning that many truncations may extensively disrupt the protein structure. With predicted structures of proteins and their complexes readily available, there is no place for \u2018blind\u2019 truncations and instead experimental or predicted structures should be used to inform design of mutations to examine protein function.\n\nAlphaFold predictions also aid in design of variants for recombinant protein expression in functional studies and biotechnology. Recombinantly expressed proteins are often insoluble, and the truncation of proteins is commonly used to improve solubility. Having more accurate predicted structures allows for more efficient selection of soluble protein domains for expression in the absence of experimental structures.\n\nProteins are frequently engineered with tags such as antigens or fluorescent proteins to facilitate cellular experiments or protein purification. However, such tags can affect protein function [[95](#B95),[96](#B96)]. This is particularly so if the residue(s) adjacent to the tag fusion site are structurally important. Examination of AlphaFold predictions at the tag site may be useful in predicting if the tag will disrupt function. Predictions of tagged variants may also be useful in identifying and circumventing these limitations; however, these predictions will likely also suffer from the limitations described above as the sequences are engineered and so co-evolutionary information will be confounded. In either case predictions of tagged variants are useful in visualizing the size of the tag compared with the protein of interest and provide structural context at the fusion site.\n\n### 3.3. Prediction of protein\u2013protein interactions\n\nAlphaFold predictions of assemblies between multiple proteins can be used for various purposes: to identify novel interacting partners, provide atomic models of well-characterized interactions that have proven intractable to experimental determination, and to resolve ambiguities in experimentally determined maps of protein assemblies. However, creating databases of predicted protein assemblies is much more computationally demanding than for monomer databases. In the human proteome, there are over 200 million possible pairwise combinations of proteins, let alone higher order assemblies. Nevertheless, organisms with simpler proteomes, such as yeast, have been studied from this perspective [[97](#B97)] and a dedicated deep-learning network for rapid prediction of PPI models has been applied to the human proteome [[47](#B47)]. There have also been several efforts targeting subsets of proteomes: (i) experimentally supported PPIs from the human proteome have been used to guide prediction of binary and higher order protein assemblies [[98](#B98),[99](#B99)], (ii) signalling and metabolic pathways have been used to focus the predictions [[48](#B48),[100](#B100),[101](#B101)], (iii) cross-kingdom plant\u2013pathogen interactions have been screened [[102](#B102)], (iv) protein ligands and peptides have been screened against protein receptors to predict the native pairings [[103](#B103)\u2013[105](#B105)], and (v) protein functions such as genome maintenance have been used to screen for pairwise protein\u2013protein interactors [[46](#B46),[106](#B106)]. Several databases for these \u2018predictomes\u2019 have been constructed ([table 1](#T1)).\n\nProtein structure prediction can also be integrated into experimental pipelines. High-throughput identification of interacting proteins can be achieved experimentally by various methods, including crosslinking mass spectrometry, genome-wide association studies, yeast two-hybrid and protein microarrays. Predictions of protein\u2013protein assemblies provide a computational high-throughput approach that can complement these experimental techniques ([figure 7](#F7)). This can be performed in parallel, where interactions of a protein of interest with all other proteins in the proteome are probed through the experimental technique and predictions, respectively. The overlap between the sets of identified interactors are then considered as the most confidently assigned interactors. Alternatively, predictions could be used in series, following high-throughput experimental techniques, to reduce the number of false-positive interactions. This would require only computing protein\u2013protein pairs that are supported by the high-throughput technique and so is less computationally expensive than the former but may miss some interactors that were not experimentally detected. For both of these approaches, a bait protein is screened against a list of potential interactors. AlphaPulldown software based on AF2-multimer has been developed for this \u2018one-vs-all\u2019 purpose [[74](#B74)]. Furthermore, AlphaLink, also derived from AF2, and Chai-1 software allow incorporation of distance constraints between atoms into structure predictions (e.g. from crosslinking experiments) [[59](#B59),[107](#B107)].\n\nIn prediction screening studies, it is critical to minimize false-positive interactors, which raises an important question\u2014where do we draw the line between an interaction or non-interaction? Negative controls for prediction screening should be considered, for example, a scrambled sequence of the target. Thresholds derived from global confidence metrics such as the ipTM can also be useful in some cases. However, many proteins interact via short motifs which can be hard to pick out in large proteins and it has been demonstrated that individually, AlphaFold metrics are not very useful in large screening approaches [[46](#B46),[48](#B48)]. pLDDT and PAE scores considering only interface residues provide an improvement over the average pLDDT and pTM scores [[108](#B108)]. Another simple approach derived from the PAE has been proposed [[48](#B48)]. This metric uses areas of the PAE involving inter-protein residue pairs, i.e. the contact PAE scores, focusing on those below a defined threshold (12 \u00c5 was found to be best). Similar to this approach, AF3 provides a minimum inter-protein PAE score. A metric that considers the agreement in predicted contacts between replicate models has also been developed, known as the \u2018average n models\u2019 [[106](#B106)]. More complex assessments involving combinations of metrics have also been developed. In particular, it has been found that incorporating additional biological metrics was superior to just using structure-based metrics such as the PAE [[46](#B46)]. This combined metric is known as the Structure Prediction and Omics informed Classifier (SPOC) and is available through the predictomes website ([table 1](#T1)). These various metrics allow ranking of predictions; however, caution should be taken with high-throughput screening against paralogues as these may generate confident predictions for non-interactors [[105](#B105)].\n\nIn addition to high-throughput screening approaches, predictions can also inform more focused mechanistic studies. Integrative structural biology combines multiple methods to determine structural features of difficult targets, such as huge protein assemblies like the nuclear pore complex [[109](#B109)]. AlphaFold models have been combined with cryoEM to model the nuclear pore complex [[110](#B110),[111](#B111)]. The wealth of atomic models of PPIs derived from predictions now means experimental validation and mechanistic studies of clusters of PPIs are a bottleneck.\n\n### 3.4. Prediction of protein binders\n\nDesign of novel proteins that bind to natural proteins is an ambitious goal that has applications, including antibody replacements, biosensors and tools that disrupt protein interactions within cells. Several new competitions have arisen to independently test designed proteins and binders [[112](#B112)]. While experimental methods, such as directed evolution, have been used in protein design, they are laborious and computational design has the potential to significantly reduce the experimental burden. State-of-the-art structure prediction has provided significant boosts to computational success rates [[113](#B113)\u2013[115](#B115)]. There is particular emphasis on the design of protein binders that allow targeting of a particular region on a target protein [[113](#B113),[116](#B116)\u2013[118](#B118)]. There have also been adaptions for binder interfaces involving \u03b2-strands [[119](#B119)], binders of \u03b1-helices [[120](#B120)] and design of cyclic peptides [[121](#B121)\u2013[123](#B123)]. Further extensions may look to the incorporation of non-natural amino acids.\n\nThese methods for binder design rely on computing thousands of different designs, both in terms of backbone geometry and sequence, then filtering them to a limited number for experimental validation of binding. Backbone geometry has been designed using either hallucination or diffusion deep-learning approaches [[113](#B113),[117](#B117)], while a graph neural network architecture, ProteinMPNN, has been used to design the sequences [[124](#B124),[125](#B125)]. The requirement to screen thousands of designs *in silico* makes these methods computationally expensive; however, a reduction in numbers needed to be experimental tested offsets this cost. Although success rates vary significantly between targets, the methods are now at a level where fewer than 100 designs may need to be experimentally tested to obtain binders ([table 3](#T3)). BindCraft is particularly promising with success rates of 10\u2013100% across 12 different protein targets, and yielding the best *de novo* binders in a recent competition by Adaptyv Bio [[126](#B126)]. However, there are still challenging targets that have proved intractable [[118](#B118)] and will likely require testing of an order of magnitude more designs and/or advances at the computational level.\n\n#### Table 3.\n\nComputational tools developed for protein binder design.\n\n| software | experimental success  (%)[a](#T3_FN1) | predictions experimentally tested per target | code licence |\n| RFdiffusion [[113](#B113)] | 7\u221235 (5 targets) | <100 | BSD License |\n| BindCraft [[117](#B117)] | 10\u2212100 (12 targets) | 6\u221253 | MIT License |\n| AlphaProteo [[118](#B118)] | 9\u221288 (7 targets)  0\u221288 (8 targets)[b](#T3_FN2) | 47\u2212172 | not currently available |\n| RFpeptides [[123](#B123)] | 21\u221238 | 6\u221214[c](#T3_FN3) | code to be released |\n\n[Open in a new tab](table/T3/)\n\na \n\nDesigns binding/designs experimentally tested, each publication used different binding targets and different criteria for success so this is only a rough comparison.\n\nb \n\nTNF\u03b1 subsequently added as a hard target.\n\nc \n\nAdditional designs failed at the chemical synthesis step.\n\nOne major class of hard targets is short linear motifs. These are short regions of proteins, generally 3\u221215 amino acids long, which participate in PPIs. Although their small size increases the computational tractability, this is offset by the fact they are typically disordered in the absence of their binding partner. Designed binders for these targets could allow for more targeted modulation of PPIs. In applications of designed binders in a biological context, determination of specificity and selectivity will be critical.\n\nAntibodies are natural protein binders that specifically recognize antigens. Antibody\u2013antigen protein pairs are not as reliably predicted as protein\u2013protein interactions in general. This is unsurprising since co-evolutionary information is not necessarily present in the binding regions of antibodies. AF3 appears to have narrowed the gap between prediction accuracy for antibody\u2013antigen and general protein\u2013protein pairs; however, may require generation of hundreds to thousands of predictions with different seeding [[53](#B53),[57](#B57)]. Similarly, AFsample and MassiveFold, both based on AF2-multimer and using thousands of predictions, were able to generate some high-confidence antibody\u2013antigen predictions [[85](#B85),[127](#B127)].\n\nGiven the importance of co-evolutionary information in determining accurate structures, one may ask: how is this information incorporated into binder design and antibody\u2013antigen predictions? Binders are typically designed to be very small, so it may not be unreasonable to expect it is only the learned structural information that is dominating the usefulness for these designs. However, another possibility is that these tools are essentially very complex \u2018structure mixers\u2019 collecting mini-motifs from many different proteins and assembling them into a single protein. Regardless, it is clear that computational protein design is rapidly maturing owing to the advances in deep-learning.\n\n### 3.5. Prediction of protein\u2013nucleic acid and protein\u2013small molecule interactions\n\nProteins interact with nucleic acids during a variety of cellular processes, and so protein\u2013nucleic acid assemblies are another important target for structural biology. As with conformational ensembles, RNA and protein-RNA assemblies were introduced in CASP15 [[128](#B128)] and DNA included in the recent CASP16 competition. The next-generation structure prediction tools, AF3, RosettaFold-All-Atom, Chai-1 and Boltz-1 allow input of arbitrary nucleic acid sequences. Although AF3 is state of the art with respect to nucleic acids, it has not reached the same level of general applicability as AF2/AF2-multimer achieved for protein monomers and PPIs [[129](#B129)]. There are far fewer experimental structures of protein\u2013nucleic acids than protein monomers or protein\u2013protein assemblies for deep-learning tools to draw information from, and so further experimental structures of protein\u2013nucleic acid assemblies would be useful to advance this class of protein structure prediction.\n\nProteins can also bind to small molecule ligands as part of their biological function or when targeted with small molecule drugs. Prediction of the latter is important for drug development and is seeing considerable interest. While there are a large number of protein\u2013small molecule structures in the PDB, there are additional complexities when considering a prediction tool that can cover all possible small molecules compared with the protein-only classes discussed in the earlier sections.\n\nWe consider prediction complexity of a class of targets to depend on the chemical complexity of all possible molecules relating to the class, and the potential co-evolutionary information that can be extracted ([figure 8](#F8)). While size of the prediction target is also important, protein and nucleic acid polymers have restricted geometry that limits the complexity added due to size, for example, protein polymers have limited backbone angles that are energetically favourable as observed in the Ramachandran plot.\n\nChemical complexity considers the number of functional groups and atom types. For polymers, chemical complexity is related to the number of different types of building blocks: 20 for proteins, four for DNAs and four for RNAs. Furthermore, nucleic acids typically form oligomers mediated by base pairing. While double-stranded DNA is the primary example, there are many other complex nucleic acid assemblies that are biologically important, such as Holliday junctions, D-loops and R-loops. As such, prediction of arbitrary protein\u2013nucleic acid assemblies is more chemically complex than any of the protein-only classes. Furthermore, small molecules generally lack the regular structure of polymers, although small molecules are much smaller than proteins. Importantly, predictions for the protein-small molecule class may require modelling of various functional groups and atom types not seen in proteins or nucleic acids. Small molecules may even consist of modified amino acid or nucleic acid units. Therefore, a tool that reliably predicts arbitrary protein\u2013small molecule assemblies has to account for the highest level of chemical complexity.\n\nCo-evolutionary information for prediction in the protein\u2013nucleic acid and protein\u2013small molecule classes is not available to the same extent as for protein\u2013protein assemblies. For the protein\u2013small molecule class, co-evolutionary information is essentially one-sided, i.e. protein residues at the binding site may be conserved but there is not additional information from MSAs involving the interacting partner to signal co-evolution, unlike for PPIs. Furthermore, small molecule binding can drive reordering of the hydrophobic core of a protein structure [[70](#B70)] and if such sites do not have a natural ligand, this could even conflict with co-evolutionary information.\n\nGenomic DNA sequences clearly evolve, raising the question: is there useful co-evolutionary information that can be extracted for prediction of protein\u2013nucleic acid complexes? The same is true for RNA sequences. While there are large databases of DNA and RNA sequences, there are only four nucleotide units each for DNA and RNA compared with the 20 amino acids of proteins. Nevertheless, co-evolutionary information has been extracted from MSAs of RNA sequences and used for prediction of RNA-only structures [[130](#B130)]. Furthermore, there are cases where proteins recognize specific nucleic acid sequences, for example, transcription factors [[131](#B131)], suggesting there may be evolutionary coupling between the protein sequence and nucleic acid sequence. In such cases, hybrid MSAs could be generated with each amino acid sequence paired with a nucleotide sequence from the same species. Overall, there is more potential for co-evolutionary information in protein interaction with nucleic acids than for small molecules; however, whether this is useful in the prediction of such assemblies remains to be seen.\n\nGiven the high chemical complexity and reduced co-evolutionary information for protein\u2013small molecules, we expect multiple major technical breakthroughs will be required before generally applicable structure prediction of this class will be solved. However, a subset of the problem that is relevant for drug design may be achievable with current technology\u2014when a small molecule binding site is already known and new small molecules are to be modelled in place. This could be particularly useful when coupled to prediction for paralogues to check for off target binding and reliable prediction of small molecule binding affinity.\n\n## 4. Outlook\n\n\u2018All models are wrong but some are useful\u2019 is a saying in statistics attributed to George Box. It is abundantly clear that the current state-of-the-art structure prediction tools have widespread use for studying both single protein chains and protein\u2013protein assemblies. The predictions serve as powerful hypothesis generators for experimental validation and this is now a bottleneck in many aspects of biology. Moreover, they contain experimental data embedded within the predictions in the form of protein co-evolution derived from massive sequencing efforts. This makes them useful complements to support other experimental techniques, both low- and high-throughput, beyond hypothesis generation. AlphaFold can be particularly useful for PPIs that are difficult to capture experimentally, for example, transient interactions which may still leave their mark on evolutionary couplings. However, it is also important to keep in mind that the usefulness of AlphaFold and other structure prediction tools will always depend on the biological question.\n\nRepurposing of AlphaFold from protein monomers to PPIs came within months of the original release. The next generation of deep-learning tools for structural predictions of interactions with non-proteins have arrived three years after the initial AlphaFold release; however, we do not believe that these have reached general utility yet. Unlike for PPIs, the co-evolutionary signal within MSAs effectively becomes \u2018one-sided\u2019 when protein\u2013nucleic acid and protein\u2013small molecule interactions are considered. While template structures can be used to guide structure predictions for protein\u2013nucleic acid and other interactions, their requirement limits generalizability. For protein monomers and PPIs, templates are frequently dispensable with AlphaFold, highlighting the general utility for these prediction classes. More protein\u2013nucleic acid experimental structures, particularly those with different DNA structures and nucleotide sequences, will allow more useful predictions and more rigorous assessment of protein\u2013nucleic acid predictions. However, there will need to be significant technical developments to allow general utility of these tools for broader biomolecular interactions.\n\nMajor applications of structure prediction in the immediate future will likely come from design of protein binders and modelling of protein conformational changes. Both of these remain in the realm of protein-only structure; however, will be immensely useful for biological and biotechnological applications. Although protein conformational changes have more complex co-evolutionary signals than rigid proteins, they retain a \u2018two-sided\u2019 signal. It is possible that extracting useful structural information about protein conformational changes may not be generalizable. However, deconvoluting direct from indirect evolutionary couplings yielded improved performance of the MSA approach, and it is tempting to speculate\u2014could deconvoluting the signal from multiple conformations boost the accuracy of all protein structure predictions even further?\n\nPrediction of large structures remains a computational challenge. Longer sequences require more GPU memory at inference time and even AF3 is capped at 5120 amino acid residues [[57](#B57)]. Furthermore, elongated structures such as coiled coils can become spuriously bent [[132](#B132)], while in AF3, disordered regions in large structures have a tendency to collapse into helical bundles. Large disordered regions can also impede identification of PPIs [[133](#B133)]. Predictions using truncations can get around some of these issues. Significant updates in speed of generating predictions have come from faster MSA generation, with a GPU implementation recently released [[134](#B134)]. This will facilitate more high-throughput predictome approaches.\n\nJust as the expansion of gene databases enabled the dramatic improvement in protein structural prediction, improvements in structural prediction can improve the quality of gene databases and provide novel evolutionary insights. As proteins are more conserved at the structural level than sequence level, alignment and clustering of predicted structures allows for the identification of homologues that would not be detected by sequence-based methods. This has allowed for improved annotation of evolutionarily distant but conserved proteins and identification of novel protein folds [[135](#B135)]. Such an approach allows for greater insight into evolutionary history across all kingdoms of life and viruses, through construction of structure-based phylogenetic trees and identification of horizontal gene transfer events that often accompany host\u2013parasite co-evolution [[41](#B41)].\n\nOverall, AlphaFold has led to a massive wealth of structural information in prediction databases and bespoke applications of the tool. Local confidence metrics, self-reported by the AlphaFold network for every prediction, facilitate determining the usefulness of each prediction. Yet, the atomic models still need to be related to protein function and so in our opinion the structure prediction revolution has, if anything, increased the need for chemical and structural literacy amongst biologists.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank members of the Walden and Grove laboratories for useful discussions.\n\n## Contributor Information\n\nMartin Luke Rennie, Email: martin.rennie@glasgow.ac.uk.\n\nMichael R.

Known as the protein folding problem, it was simple to state: Could they accurately predict the three-dimensional shape of a protein molecule from the barest of information \u2014 its one-dimensional molecular code? Proteins keep our cells and bodies alive and running. Because the shape of a protein determines its behavior, successfully solving this problem would have profound implications for our understanding of diseases, production of new medicines and insight into how life works.\n\nAt the conference, held every other year, the scientists put their latest protein-folding tools to the test. But a solution always loomed beyond reach. Some of them had spent their entire careers trying to get just incrementally better at such predictions. These competitions were marked by baby steps, and the researchers had little reason to think that 2020 would be any different.\n\nThey were wrong about that.\n\nThat week, a relative newcomer to the protein science community named John Jumper had presented a new artificial intelligence tool, AlphaFold2, which had emerged from the offices of Google DeepMind, the tech company\u2019s artificial intelligence arm in London. Over Zoom, he presented data showing that AlphaFold2\u2019s predictive models of 3D protein structures were over 90% accurate \u2014 five times better than those of its closest competitor.\n\nIn an instant, the protein folding problem had gone from impossible to painless. The success of artificial intelligence where the human mind had floundered rocked the community of biologists. \u201cI was in shock,\u201d said [Mohammed AlQuraishi](https://systemsbiology.columbia.edu/faculty/mohammed-alquraishi), a systems biologist at Columbia University\u2019s Program for Mathematical Genomics, who attended the meeting. \u201cA lot of people were in denial.\u201d\n\nBut in the conference\u2019s concluding remarks, its organizer John Moult left little room for doubt: AlphaFold2 had \u201clargely solved\u201d the protein folding problem \u2014 and shifted protein science forever. Sitting in front of a bookshelf in his home office in a black turtleneck, clicking through his slides on Zoom, Moult spoke in tones that were excited but also ominous. \u201cThis is not an end but a beginning,\u201d he said.\n\n Share this article \n\n[](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-ai-revolutionized-protein-science-but-didnt-end-it-20240626/)[](https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-ai-revolutionized-protein-science-but-didnt-end-it-20240626/&text=How+AI+Revolutionized+Protein+Science%2C+but+Didn%E2%80%99t+End+It&via=QuantaMagazine)[Copied!](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-ai-revolutionized-protein-science-but-didnt-end-it-20240626/)[](https://www.quantamagazine.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n\n[](https://getpocket.com/save?url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-ai-revolutionized-protein-science-but-didnt-end-it-20240626/&title=How+AI+Revolutionized+Protein+Science%2C+but+Didn%E2%80%99t+End+It)[](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-ai-revolutionized-protein-science-but-didnt-end-it-20240626/)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-ai-revolutionized-protein-science-but-didnt-end-it-20240626/&t=How+AI+Revolutionized+Protein+Science%2C+but+Didn%E2%80%99t+End+It)[](https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-ai-revolutionized-protein-science-but-didnt-end-it-20240626/)\n\n* * *\n\n Newsletter \n\n_Get Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox_\n\n[Subscribe now](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-ai-revolutionized-protein-science-but-didnt-end-it-20240626/#newsletter)\n\n[Recent newsletters](http://us1.campaign-archive2.com/home/?u=0d6ddf7dc1a0b7297c8e06618&id=f0cb61321c)\n\n![Image 4](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ProteinHallOfFame_ProteinHallOfFame-crQuantaMagazine_RCSBPDB-Mobile.webp)![Image 5](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ProteinHallOfFame_ProteinHallOfFame-crQuantaMagazine_RCSBPDB-Desktop-scaled.webp)\n\n_Quanta Magazine_; source: [RCSB PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/)\n\nProteins are molecules that come in hundreds of millions of different shapes. Each one serves a particular biological function, from carrying oxygen through the blood to sparking chemical reactions. The function is typically defined by its shape or structure.\n\n_Quanta Magazine_; source: [RCSB PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/)\n\nWhen Google\u2019s public relations machine churned the news out to the world, the media went wild. Headlines claimed that AlphaFold2 \u201c[will change everything](http://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03348-4).\u201d Protein biologists who had spent their entire careers investigating the structures of single proteins feared that they would lose their jobs. Some claimed that AlphaFold2 would revolutionize drug development; now that biologists could quickly learn proteins\u2019 shapes, they could create new medicines that could target them. Others pushed back, arguing that the results were mostly hype and little would change.\n\nMoult could barely comprehend the news himself. He ended the conference with the question on everyone\u2019s mind: \u201cWhat now?\u201d\n\nThat was three and a half years ago. It\u2019s finally possible to start answering his question.\n\nIt\u2019s the biggest \u2018machine learning in science\u2019 story that there has been.\n\nMohammed AlQuraishi, Columbia University\n\nAlphaFold2 has undeniably shifted the way biologists study proteins. However, while AlphaFold2 is a powerful prediction tool, it\u2019s not an omniscient machine. It has solved one part of the protein folding problem very cleverly, but not the way a scientist would. It has not replaced biological experiments but rather emphasized the need for them.\n\nPerhaps AlphaFold2\u2019s biggest impact has been drawing biologists\u2019 attention to the power of artificial intelligence. It has already inspired new algorithms, including ones that design new proteins not found in nature; new biotech companies; and new ways to practice science. And its successor, AlphaFold3, which was [announced in May 2024](https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-ai-tools-predict-how-lifes-building-blocks-assemble-20240508/), has moved to the next phase of biological prediction by modeling the structures of proteins in combination with other molecules like DNA or RNA.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest \u2018machine learning in science\u2019 story that there has been,\u201d AlQuraishi said.\n\nHowever, there are still massive gaps that artificial intelligence hasn\u2019t filled. These tools can\u2019t simulate how proteins change through time or model them in the context in which they exist: within cells. \u201cAlphaFold changed everything and nothing,\u201d said [Paul Adams](https://biosciences.lbl.gov/profiles/paul-d-adams/), a structural biologist who develops algorithms to model the structures of biomolecules at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\nThis is the story of how Jumper\u2019s team at Google DeepMind pulled off their coup in protein science, and what it means for the future of artificial intelligence in biology.\n\n![Image 6](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/medium-1.jpg)\n\nPart 1\n======\n\n**Formulating the Problem**\n---------------------------\n\nA piece of origami paper is little more than pressed wood pulp until it\u2019s folded in specific ways; then it becomes something new. A few precise crimps and flips, and it\u2019s a fortune teller, a paper device that can predict your future. Take the same piece of paper, change a few of the folding steps, and now it\u2019s a winged crane, granting good fortune to its recipient.\n\nSimilarly, a long string of amino acid molecules has no function until it spontaneously folds into its innate shape, which biologists call its structure. A protein\u2019s structure determines how it binds to or otherwise interacts with other molecules, and therefore defines its role in a cell.\n\n![Image 7](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Quanta_Protein-Folding_2024_Mobile-v2_Levels_of_Protein_Structure-crMarkBelan-Mobile-v2.svg)![Image 8](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Quanta_Protein-Folding_2024_Desktop-v2_Levels_of_Protein_Structure-crMarkBelan-Desktop-v2.svg)\n\nMark Belan for _Quanta Magazine_\n\nThere are a couple hundred million known proteins on the planet and many more unknown ones. They do it all: Hemoglobin and myoglobin ferry oxygen around the muscles and body. Keratin gives structure to hair, nails and skin. Insulin enables glucose to move into cells to be converted into energy. Proteins can take on a seemingly infinite number of shapes to match the seemingly infinite number of jobs they do in life.\n\n\u201cRight from the atom all the way to ecosystems, [protein structure] is kind of a lingua franca,\u201d AlQuraishi said. \u201cIt\u2019s where everything happens.\u201d\n\nA cell makes proteins by daisy-chaining small molecules called amino acids into long polypeptide strings. The amino acids it chooses depends on the underlying set of instructions provided to it by DNA. Within a fraction of a second of its creation, a polypeptide string bends, buckles and folds precisely into the protein\u2019s final three-dimensional shape. Once off the molecular assembly line, it scurries along to do its biological work.\n\nIf proteins didn\u2019t perform this folding process exceedingly well, cascades of disasters would tumble through the body. An incorrectly folded or unraveled protein can lead to toxicity and cell death. Many diseases and disorders, such as sickle cell anemia, are caused by misfolded proteins. And misfolded proteins can aggregate into clumps that are hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s.\n\nYet no one really knows specifically how protein folding happens. How does the sequence information in these simple molecular chains encode a protein\u2019s complex shape? This is the \u201cmost profound question that we can ask,\u201d said [George Rose](https://biophysics.jhu.edu/directory/george-d-rose/), a biophysics professor emeritus at Johns Hopkins University.\n\n![Image 9](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ChristianAnfinsen-crPBHImages_Alamy.webp)\n\nIn the 1950s, the biochemist Christian Anfinsen conducted experiments which suggested that a string of amino acids contains an internal code telling it how to fold into a protein \u2014 and that there should be a way to predict the protein\u2019s shape from that code. This hypothesis is known as Anfinsen\u2019s dogma.\n\nPBH Images/Alamy\n\nScientists were probing this question as far back as the 1930s. But efforts really took off in the mid-1950s when the biochemist Christian Anfinsen added proteins to chemical solutions that either unfolded them by breaking their bonds or caused them to fold incorrectly. Then he observed what they did next. Anfinsen saw that the unfolded or misfolded proteins could spontaneously refold into their correct structures. His findings, which later [won him a Nobel Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1972/anfinsen/biographical/), demonstrated that proteins form their 3D shapes from an internal code \u2014 the one written by their string of amino acids.\n\n![Image 10](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/05.png)\n\nAnfinsen [hypothesized](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/anfinsen-lecture.pdf) that there should, therefore, be a way to predict a protein\u2019s shape from the sequence of its amino acids. This became generally known as the protein folding problem.\n\nOnce its polypeptide chain is assembled, a protein can fold into its structure within a thousandth of a second \u2014 a timescale that perplexed the molecular biologist Cyrus Levinthal. In his 1969 paper \u201c[How to Fold Graciously](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/bio_sim/articles/proteins_levinthal_1969.pdf),\u201d Levinthal calculated that if a protein were to try out every possible folding option, it would take an impossibly long time to assemble. Clearly, he mused, something must send the protein down the right folding pathway more directly.\n\nOver time, the protein folding problem has forked into new kinds of problems. Now three main questions are posed: Can a protein\u2019s structure be predicted from its amino acid sequence? What is the folding code? And what is the folding mechanism?\n\nThese questions started to burrow into scientists\u2019 brains in the early 1960s when the first experimentally determined protein structures became available. Max Perutz and John Kendrew, two biologists at the University of Cambridge, grew proteins into crystals, bombarded them with X-rays and measured how the rays bent \u2014 a technique known as X-ray crystallography. By doing so, they determined the 3D structures of hemoglobin and myoglobin. It took them more than two decades. They shared a Nobel Prize for their discoveries.\n\n![Image 11: Two men stand over a physical protein model with many rods pointing upward, onto which they attach balls and sticks to create a 3D structure.](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/JohnKendrewAndMaxPerutz-1960s-crMRCLaboratoryOfMolecularBiology.webp)\n\nJohn Kendrew (left) and Max Perutz (right) meticulously uncovered the structures of hemoglobin and myoglobin using X-ray crystallography. Then they built physical models using balls (atoms) and sticks (chemical bonds).\n\nMRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology\n\nSince then, innumerable researchers have strived to understand not just what different proteins look like, but how they come to look that way. \u201cIt\u2019s a very human thing to want to know what things look like, because then you can understand how they function,\u201d said [Helen Walden](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/molecularbiosciences/staff/helenwalden/), a structural biologist at the University of Glasgow. Some looked into the chemistry of the problem, others into the physics. Experimentalists reconstructed protein shapes through painstaking lab work. Computational biologists hunted for clues with models and simulations, which they programmed and reprogrammed with different combinations of algorithmic rules.\n\nAs more structures came along, the protein science community needed a way to organize and share them. In 1971, the [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/) was founded as an archive for protein structures. Freely available, the data bank became a dependable tool for anyone who needed to know the structure of a protein to probe a biological question.\n\nWhen the Protein Data Bank opened, it held the structures of seven proteins. By the time Google DeepMind used it to train AlphaFold2 nearly 50 years later, it held more than 140,000 \u2014 each laboriously decoded by the scientists known as structural biologists.\n\n**The Experimentalists\u2019 Agony**\n-------------------------------\n\nStarting in the mid-1970s, every few months Janet Thornton reliably received a package in the mail. Inside was a 12-inch magnetic tape containing data about new protein structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. A biophysicist at the University of Oxford, Thornton would eagerly rip open the package so she could analyze the new structures nearly as soon as they were discovered. The first tape Thornton received had only 20 structures on it.\n\n![Image 12: Portrait of Janet Thornton.](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/JanetThornton-crJeffDowling_EMBL-EBI-scaled.webp)\n\n\u201cI had many students who said, \u2018I want to come and solve the protein folding problem,\u2019\u201d said Janet Thornton, a structural biologist who [retired](https://www.embl.org/news/lab-matters/janet-thornton-retires-a-pioneer-in-structural-bioinformatics/) from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory last year. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t have any new ideas, frankly, about how to do that.\u201d\n\nJeff Dowling, EMBL-EBI\n\nEvery one of those proteins represented years of work. Often a doctoral candidate would spend their four or more years in graduate school crystallizing a single protein, collecting data from it or interpreting that data to figure out the folded structure.\n\nOxford\u2019s department of biophysics was, at the time, one of the world\u2019s centers for X-ray crystallography. There, in 1965, David Phillips, one of the pioneers of protein crystallography, first determined the structure of an enzyme: lysozyme, which the immune system uses to attack bacteria. Using X-ray crystallography, Oxford biophysicists created maps of proteins\u2019 electron density; the areas in which electrons congregated were likely to contain an atom. Thornton and her colleagues printed these electron density maps onto plastic sheets and stacked them one on top of another to create a \u201ccontour map\u201d of the protein\u2019s geography, she said.\n\n![Image 13](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PenicillinModel_ElectronDensityMap-Diptych-3-scaled.webp)\n\nX-ray crystallography helps scientists build electron density maps, which visualize where electrons congregate and therefore where atoms likely sit in a molecule. By stacking the maps on top of one another (left), scientists can deduce the structure of a protein or another molecule like penicillin (right).\n\nScience Museum Group\n\nThen they converted the maps into physical models. They placed their plastic maps into a Richards box, named for the Oxford biophysicist Frederic Richards, who invented the device in 1968. Inside a Richards box, an angled mirror reflected the maps into a workspace, allowing the scientists to see exactly where each atom was located relative to others. Then they physically built their model out of balls and sticks.\n\nThis method was cumbersome and restrictive. In 1971, Louise Johnson, who would go on to become an eminent crystallographer, was modeling phosphorylase, which at 842 amino acids was at the time the largest protein anyone had worked on. To model it, Johnson had to climb a ladder into a two-story Richards box, which Oxford constructed especially for her project.\n\nOnce a model was complete, scientists used a ruler to measure the distances between atoms to come up with coordinates for the protein structure. \u201cIt was archaic,\u201d Thornton said. Then they fed the coordinates into a computer. The computerized version looked like a dense forest, she said, with atoms clumped together in a jumble. Only when Thornton looked at the structure through 3D glasses could she start to see the protein\u2019s topology.\n\n\u201cIt was a very torturous process,\u201d Thornton said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that it got done.\u201d\n\n![Image 14](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Quanta_Protein-Folding_2024_Mobile-v2_How_X_Ray_Crystallography_Works-crMarkBelan-Mobile-v2.svg)![Image 15](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Quanta_Protein-Folding_2024_Desktop-v2_How_X_Ray_Crystallography_Works-crMarkBelan-Desktop-v2.svg)\n\nMark Belan for _Quanta Magazine_\n\nYear by agonizing year, they did it. Once researchers were confident in their protein structure, they submitted it to the Protein Data Bank. By 1984, 152 proteins had been deposited. In 1992, that number climbed to 747.\n\nWhile the experimentalists toiled on with their physical models, another faction of protein biologists \u2014 the computational scientists \u2014 took a different approach. But as they pondered Anfinsen\u2019s insight that a protein\u2019s structure should be predictable from its amino acid sequence, they got a bit overconfident.\n\n**Writing Their Own Rules**\n---------------------------\n\nAs an undergraduate in the early 1960s, John Moult planned to become a physicist. Then he learned about the protein folding problem. \u201cSomebody came and gave a lecture about biology being too important to leave to the biologists,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich I arrogantly took seriously.\u201d Captivated, he took his career in a different direction.\n\nAfter he graduated, Moult went into protein crystallography. He decoded the structures of several proteins, including beta-lactamase, a bacterial enzyme that destroys penicillin, and received his doctorate in molecular biophysics at Oxford in 1970. But as he started his postdoc, he tired of the experimentalist approach and began to drift toward the growing field of protein computation. Computational biologists, as opposed to experimentalists, wrote computer algorithms to try and prove that Anfinsen was right: that they could feed a program a string of amino acids to generate a correct protein structure.\n\n![Image 16: Portrait of John Moult.](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/JohnMoult-crUmitGulsen_QuantaMagazine-scaled.webp)\n\nJohn Moult co-founded the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) experiment to force himself and other computational biologists to test their computer models of proteins against experimentally determined protein structures.\n\nUmit Gulsen for _Quanta Magazine_\n\nThe transition from biological experiments to computation was an uneasy one. Moult was used to the slow, careful work of solving a single protein structure. In his new field, computational papers regularly claimed to have solved the protein folding problem and related sub-problems.\n\nMoult was dubious. \u201cThe things that were being published in that area were not as rigorous as I was used to,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not because we\u2019re all a load of crooks in this field. It\u2019s because if you\u2019re doing this sort of computational work, you\u2019re doing it in a virtual world.\u201d\n\nIn a virtual world, computationalists wrote their own rules when the rules of the natural world didn\u2019t work. They designed their algorithms so that atoms stuck together in a certain way or the protein always folded to the right or the left. Over time, the models drifted farther away from reality. It\u2019s hard to maintain rigor in a world where you have complete control, Moult said.\n\nStill, he could see the value of both sides. Experimentalists worked precisely but slowly; computationalists worked quickly but were so removed from biophysical realities that they were often wrong.\n\nThere must be a way, he thought, to bring the best of both approaches together.\n\n**The Stamping Begins**\n-----------------------\n\nIn the early 1990s, Moult and his colleague [Krzysztof Fidelis](https://goldlabfoundation.org/presenters/krzysztof-fidelis-phd/) had an idea for bringing discipline to the field\u2019s chaos. They set up a community science experiment that they called the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction, or CASP.\n\n![Image 17](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/04.png)\n\nThe idea was simple. As CASP\u2019s organizers, Moult and Fidelis would publish a list of amino acid sequences for proteins whose structures had been recently solved and supplied to them by experimentalists, but for which the results hadn\u2019t yet been published. Then computational groups around the world would try their best to predict the protein\u2019s structure using whatever method they wanted. An independent group of scientists would assess the models by comparing their answers to the experimentally confirmed structures.\n\nThe idea took off. CASP soon became a proving ground for computational approaches to the protein folding problem. These were the days before artificial intelligence, when computational approaches involved simulating molecular physics. It was a chance for scientists to put their thinking to the test in a public trial against their peers. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be a competition,\u201d Thornton said. \u201cBut it actually has turned out to be a competition.\u201d\n\nEvery two years, scientists gathered at the Asilomar conference center, an old chapel near Monterey, California, that used to be a Methodist retreat. During these conferences, the organizers announced the competition\u2019s results and the computationalists gave talks about their methods and approaches. Moult encouraged attendees to stamp their feet on the wooden floors if they didn\u2019t like what they were hearing.\n\n\u201cThere was, at the beginning, quite a lot of stamping,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was \u201calmost like a drum,\u201d recalled [David Jones](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.jones/), a professor of bioinformatics at University College London who studied under Thornton. The biologists stamped if the talks got bogged down in details. They stamped if claims were overblown. They stamped if speakers were repetitive or too much in the weeds. But it was friendly stamping, Jones said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t nasty.\u201d\n\n![Image 18: Rows of wooden benches sit inside a wooden structure.](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AsilomarConferenceGrounds-crAramarkDestinations.webp)\n\nThe early CASP conferences were held at the Asilomar conference center in Monterey, California. When attendees stamped on the wooden floors, it sounded like a drum.\n\nAramark Destinations\n\nWhatever the reason, when the echoes of stamping started ringing in a speaker\u2019s ears, it was embarrassing. \u201cThank God I never got stamped on,\u201d Jones said. One year, he and his colleagues presented a computational method called threading, in which amino acid sequences were woven through known protein structures to search for a fit. They didn\u2019t do too badly. \u201cWe were quite pleased. \u2026 It was all downhill after that,\u201d Jones recalled, laughing. \u201cNo, it was fun.\u201d\n\nPeople thought that they could become millionaires because they had the right algorithm, and others thought that they would win the Nobel Prize.\n\nSilvio Tosatto, University of Padua\n\nThere was a lot of excitement back then, said [Silvio Tosatto](https://protein.bio.unipd.it/people/silvio), a professor of bioinformatics at the University of Padua. \u201cPeople thought that they could become millionaires because they had the right algorithm, and some other people thought that they would immediately win the Nobel Prize.\u201d\n\nNeither of those things happened during the early years. When asked what the CASP submissions were like during that time, Moult paused. \u201c\u2018Random\u2019 is a good word,\u201d he said.\n\nSome methods performed better than expected, such as \u201chomology modeling,\u201d which compared the structures of known proteins to deduce the structures of unknown ones. Others were a dead loss. Most structure predictions were \u201ctortured-looking objects,\u201d Moult said.\n\n\u201cI was loving seeing them fail,\u201d joked [Anastassis Perrakis](https://www.nki.nl/research/research-groups/anastassis-tassos-perrakis/), a structural biologist at the Netherlands Cancer Institute and Utrecht University who gave experimentally determined structures to CASP organizers for use in the competition. \u201cIt\u2019s not rivalry, but we like to tease each other in science.\u201d\n\nThrough this process, clear leaders emerged. In 1996, after the second CASP wrapped up, a young man named David Baker asked Jones to share a taxi to the airport. Baker had seen Jones\u2019 talk and was working on his own computational model. He didn\u2019t have it ready for this CASP, but he wanted to chat about it. Jones listened to his ideas in the cab and never expected to see him again.\n\nAt the next competition in 1998, Baker blew the doors wide open with his algorithm Rosetta. He became \u201cthe man to beat,\u201d Jones said.\n\n![Image 19: Portrait of David Baker](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DavidBaker-crBBVAFoundation-02-1720x945.webp)\n\n By clicking to watch this video, you agree to our [privacy policy.](https://www.quantamagazine.org/privacy-policy)\n\n**Video**: This is the inside story of how David Baker (pictured here), Demis Hassabis and John Jumper won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for advances in computer-assisted protein design and structure prediction.\n\nChristopher Webb Young/_Quanta Magazine_; Photo: BBVA Foundation\n\nAlgorithms like Rosetta modeled interactions between the atoms of amino acid molecules to predict how they would fold. They \u201cshowed that you actually could predict protein structure,\u201d Baker said. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t good enough or accurate enough to be useful.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, humans were still beating the computers. [Baker](https://www.ipd.uw.edu/david-baker/), who by then was running his own lab at the University of Washington, created a free online computer game called [Foldit](https://fold.it/), in which players folded strings of amino acids into protein structures. In a paper published in _Nature_, his team reported that human Foldit players [outperformed Rosetta](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09304) in modeling proteins.\n\nBut the human lead wouldn\u2019t last long. In the early 2010s, important breakthroughs in a concept known as co-evolution propelled the field forward and would later turn out to be critical for artificial intelligence. The idea, which had been around for decades, was straightforward: By comparing closely related sequences of amino acids in hundreds to thousands of proteins, scientists could identify the amino acids that had mutated \u2014 and, importantly, determine whether they\u2019d mutated in step with others. If two amino acids changed together, they were likely linked in some way. \u201cYou start to be able to say, \u2018Well, these two things are probably close together in space,\u2019\u201d said Adams, the structural biologist at Berkeley Lab.\n\n![Image 20](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Protein_Co_Evolution_Reveals_Structure-crMarkBelan-Desktop-v1.svg)\n\nMark Belan for _Quanta Magazine_\n\nBut until the early 2010s, such predictions of which amino acids were in contact were dismal. Their accuracy hovered between 20% and 24%. Then scientists noticed that their statistical methods were introducing errors, suggesting that some amino acids were in contact when they weren\u2019t. Later, Moult learned that statisticians had been keenly aware of this kind of error for decades. When you looked back, he said, you\u2019d think, \u201cHow could I be so stupid?\u201d\n\nComputational biologists [cleaned up the statistical tools](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0028766). By 2016, the accuracy of contact prediction had shot up to 47%. Two years later, it reached 70%. Baker\u2019s algorithm built on this success: In 2014, Rosetta produced two protein structures so accurate that a CASP assessor thought Baker might have solved the protein folding problem.\n\nThe co-evolution insights were \u201cfantastic,\u201d Adams said. Without using machine learning, co-evolution was \u201cone of the big things that came that really pushed that field forward.\u201d\n\nHowever, it got the field only so far. Co-evolution required an abundance of similar proteins to compare, and experimentalists weren\u2019t solving protein structures fast enough to supply computationalists\u2019 needs.\n\nThe years flowed by in a punctuated equilibrium, Moult said, using a term from evolutionary biology. Sometimes it felt as though no good ideas had evolved for a billion years \u2014 and then something exciting would happen.\n\n![Image 21](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/medium-2.jpg)\n\n**Part 2**\n==========\n\n**Off the Deep End**\n--------------------\n\nIn 2016, David Jones caught a glimpse of the future in [a new paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature16961) in _Nature_. Researchers from Google DeepMind, an artificial intelligence team based in London, detailed how their algorithm, which used a method known as deep learning, had beaten a human champion at an ancient board game called Go.\n\nJones was amazed. \u201cThings are happening,\u201d he recalled thinking at the time. \u201cI\u2019m really going to have to get into this deep learning.\u201d\n\nDeep learning is a flavor of artificial intelligence loosely inspired by the human brain. In your brain, molecular information is sent across an interconnected web of brain cells called neurons. Neurons have little arms called dendrites that grab molecules dispatched by neighboring neurons which tell the receiving neuron either to fire and propagate a signal or not to fire.\n\n\u201cIf enough activity comes at that neuron, then that neuron is going to fire,\u201d said [Michael Littman](https://www.littmania.com/), a computer science professor at Brown University. That results in another wave of molecules being released to the next neuron.\n\nIn the 1950s, computer scientists realized that they could wire electronic bits together to create \u201cneural networks.\u201d Every unit in the neural network is a node, which researchers likened to a neuron: A neuron receives information from other neurons, then calculates whether to fire toward the next ones. In neural networks, information propagates [across multiple layers of neurons](https://www.quantamagazine.org/foundations-built-for-a-general-theory-of-neural-networks-20190131/) to produce a particular outcome, like recognizing a dog in an image.\n\n![Image 22](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/How_Neural_Networks_Work-crMarkBelan-Desktop-v1.svg)\n\nMark Belan for _Quanta Magazine_\n\nThe more layers of neurons you have, the more intricate calculations you can perform. But early neural networks were made up of only two layers. In the 1990s, that number increased to three, and it stayed there for two decades. \u201cWe could not figure out how to reliably create networks that were deeper than that,\u201d Littman said.\n\nStructural biologists, including Jones and Moult, had tried using neural networks in protein science since the 1990s, but the limitations of shallow networks and sparse data held them back. Then, in the early 2010s, computer scientists learned how to better structure neural networks to allow reliable training of more layers. Networks deepened to 20, 50, 100 and then thousands of layers. \u201cTo distinguish that from the way we were doing it in the \u201990s, people started to call it \u2018deep learning,\u2019\u201d Littman said. \u201cBecause if machine learning people are good at one thing, it\u2019s making up sexy names.\u201d\n\nDeep learning transformed artificial intelligence, leading to algorithms that excelled at recognizing features in photos or voices \u2014 and, it turns out, at beating humans in games.\n\nIn March 2016, when DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis was in Seoul watching his AI system AlphaGo beat a human world champion in the ancient game of Go, he flashed back to playing Foldit as an undergraduate. He wondered: If DeepMind researchers could write an algorithm to mimic [the intuition of Go masters](https://www.quantamagazine.org/is-alphago-really-such-a-big-deal-20160329/), couldn\u2019t they write one to mimic the intuition of Foldit gamers, who knew nothing about biology but could fold proteins?\n\n![Image 23](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AlphaGoVsLeeSedol-crGoogleDeepMind.webp)\n\nIn 2016, AlphaGo, an AI system by Google DeepMind, defeated Lee Sedol (right), the world champion in the ancient game of Go. Its ability to mimic human intuition drew biologists\u2019 attention to the potential power of deep learning in protein science.\n\nGoogle DeepMind\n\n[Jinbo Xu](https://home.ttic.edu/~jinbo/), a professor at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, also recognized the potential of using deep learning to attack the protein folding problem. He was inspired by what these networks were doing in image recognition. By then, computer scientists had had great success with convolutional networks, which program deep learning algorithms to break images into pieces and identify patterns between them. Xu brought this technique to protein folding. He used a mathematical object called a matrix to represent which amino acids were close together in space, then fed the data into a convolutional network as an image. The algorithm looked for patterns among these images to predict the 3D coordinates of the atoms that make up a protein.\n\n![Image 24](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/02.png)\n\nIn 2016, Xu posted [a preprint](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1609.00680) of this work on arxiv.org (it was later published in [_PLOS Computational Biology_](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005324)) that \u201cwas quite influential\u201d for the field, Moult said. It showed people \u201cthe sort of things you might do with deep learning.\u201d\n\nBefore long, protein structure groups started dabbling in deep learning. AlQuraishi and his team were the first to develop an approach that could directly predict protein structure exclusively with neural networks, in what\u2019s called an \u201cend-to-end\u201d method \u2014 it just didn\u2019t work very well. Others wondered how they could dip their toes into a new approach that felt so momentous.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know exactly what I wanted to do with deep learning, but I realized I needed to be doing deep learning,\u201d Jones said.\n\nHe had started to write grant applications to find his way in when he received an email from Google DeepMind. They asked Jones about the CASP competition and offered help. \u201cI just assumed they meant: We\u2019ve got lots of computer power,\u201d Jones said.\n\nAfter he met them, it became obvious that Google had larger ambitions. But to pull them off, the tech giant would need more scientific brainpower.\n\n**A New Player on the Field**\n-----------------------------\n\nIn 2016, when Jones started working as a consultant for Google DeepMind on a project that would later be known as AlphaFold, John Jumper was completing his doctorate in theoretical chemistry at the University of Chicago.\n\nAs a teenager, Jumper had taught himself how to program computers. He also had a knack for physics. So when it came time to go to college, he decided to study math and physics even though his parents, both engineers, were worried he\u2019d never be able to find a job.\n\n\u201cI thought I was going to be a \u2018laws of the universe\u2019 physicist all the way through,\u201d Jumper said. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved this notion of discovering something true of the universe.\u201d\n\n![Image 25](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/JohnJumper-coJohnJumper.webp)\n\nAs an undergraduate, John Jumper studied physics and math, and then got a job creating computer simulations of proteins. These experiences set him up to lead Google DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold project.\n\nCourtesy of John Jumper\n\nAs an undergraduate at Vanderbilt University, he joined a collaboration with researchers at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory to study the strange properties of [subatomic particles called quarks](https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-goes-on-in-a-proton-quark-math-still-conflicts-with-experiments-20200506/). One day, when he was sitting at a lunch table with the researchers, he got some sour news. \u201cSo, this experiment that we\u2019re working on \u2014 when\u2019s it going to turn on?\u201d Jumper recalled asking them. One of the professors said that he\u2019d probably retire first. The other, a bit older, said he might not live to see it.\n\n\u201cI wanted to do science in a little shorter timeframe than that,\u201d Jumper said. After finishing undergrad, he started a doctoral program in theoretical condensed matter physics \u2014 and quickly dropped out. He had gotten a job at D.E. Shaw Research, a New York company that, at the time, was creating basic simulations of proteins. By understanding how proteins move and change, they hoped to better understand the mechanisms of various ailments like lung cancer.\n\nIt was the first time Jumper grasped the potential significance of his work. \u201cIt\u2019s about health and extending people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. For the next three years, Jumper modeled protein movements on the company\u2019s supercomputers, which they had built specifically to simulate molecules faster. \u201cI was doing more simulation on a Tuesday of some weeks than I was going to do in my entire Ph.D.,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2011, he gave graduate school another shot, this time studying theoretical chemistry at the University of Chicago. He was still interested in protein structure and movement. But he was frustrated by the slow pace of academia. \u201cI no longer had this access to this custom computer hardware\u201d he had used at D.E. Shaw, Jumper said. He wondered if he could use artificial intelligence \u2014 \u201cat the time we called it statistical physics\u201d \u2014 to reach a level of quick simulation that otherwise required advanced machines. He began dabbling in machine learning and neural networks.\n\nDuring this time, he also started thinking about the protein folding problem. He suspected that the problem should be solvable with the training data available in the Protein Data Bank \u2014 by 2012, it contained more than 76,000 protein structures.\n\n\u201cI believed that the data were sufficient,\u201d Jumper said. But \u201cthe ideas weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Jumper heard a rumor that Google DeepMind was getting into protein structure prediction. He had just completed his doctorate, using machine learning to simulate protein folding and dynamics. He applied for a job as a research scientist.\n\n\u201cThe project was still secret,\u201d he said. If he raised the subject of protein folding in an interview, the DeepMind team changed the subject. \u201cYou can only do that so many times before I\u2019m pretty sure what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Jumper said.\n\n![Image 26](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DeepMindHeadquarters-crBuildington.webp)\n\nGoogle DeepMind is headquartered in London.\n\nBuildington\n\nIn October 2017, he arrived at DeepMind\u2019s London office. With Jones\u2019 help as a consultant, the team was already deep into the development of AlphaFold. \u201cIt was a great fun time where we were just throwing ideas at the wall,\u201d Jones said. \u201cEventually, a good core idea emerged, and they ran with it.\u201d\n\nTo train their algorithm, the DeepMind team used more than 140,000 structures from the Protein Data Bank. They fed this information into a convolutional network, but didn\u2019t change much about the AI architecture itself. It was \u201cstandard machine learning,\u201d Jumper said.\n\nBy the spring of 2018, AlphaFold was ready to join CASP and compete against bona fide protein scientists. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like Formula One racing,\u201d Jones reflected. \u201cYou think you\u2019ve built the best car, but you just don\u2019t know what the other teams have built.\u201d The stakes felt high. The DeepMind team debated whether they should compete anonymously; they didn\u2019t want to risk humiliation.\n\nIf you\u2019re a multibillion-dollar tech company, it\u2019s not a good look if you tried to do something and failed.\n\nDavid Jones, University College London\n\n\u201cNobody wants to fail,\u201d Jones said. In academia, it\u2019s part of the job; you fail, and you move on because you don\u2019t have a choice. \u201cBut obviously if you\u2019re a multibillion-dollar tech company, it\u2019s not a good look if you tried to do something and failed.\u201d\n\nThey ultimately decided to submit their results under the Google DeepMind name. A few months before the December meeting, Jones heard from CASP\u2019s organizers. They suggested that the DeepMind team come along to the meeting because AlphaFold had performed really well.\n\nTheir victory wasn\u2019t massive \u2014 they were about 2.5 times better at predicting protein structures compared to the next-best team \u2014 but their win made an impression. \u201cIt was clear something interesting had happened,\u201d Moult said.\n\n**Rebooting the Algorithm**\n---------------------------\n\nThe win should have energized the DeepMind team. But they knew they weren\u2019t close to solving the protein folding problem. Hassabis had gathered them a few months earlier. \u201cAre we going to go after solving this or not?\u201d Jumper recalled him saying. \u201cIf not, let\u2019s find problems that we can have this really, really big impact on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had this moment where we really decided: We are going to go after solving it,\u201d Jumper said. They went back to the drawing board.\n\n![Image 27: John Jumper portrait](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/JohnJumper-crGoogleDeepMind-1.webp)\n\nJohn Jumper suspected that biologists had studied enough protein structures to solve the protein folding problem. \u201cI believed that the data were sufficient,\u201d said Jumper, who started working at Google DeepMind in 2017. But \u201cthe ideas weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nGoogle DeepMind\n\nWith his diverse background in physics, chemistry, biology and computation, Jumper brought original insights to brainstorming sessions. Soon, he was leading the team, which had grown from six to 15 people. \u201cThere was something very unique going on,\u201d said Raphael Townshend, who interned at Google DeepMind in 2019 and later founded Atomic AI, an AI-driven biotech company.\n\nIn academia, experts are often siloed from one another, each pursuing independent projects with little collaboration. At DeepMind, experts in statistics, structural biology, computational chemistry, software engineering and more worked together on the protein folding problem. They also had the massive financial and computational resources of Google behind them. \u201cThings that would have taken me months to do as a Ph.D. student, I was doing in a single day,\u201d Townshend said.\n\nThe London DeepMind office was high-energy, he said, and much of that energy was generated by Jumper. \u201cHe\u2019s a true genius, I would say, and also a very humble person,\u201d said the computer scientist [Ellen Zhong](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~zhonge/), who interned at DeepMind in 2021 and is now an assistant professor at Princeton University. \u201cHe was beloved by the team.\u201d\n\nUnder Jumper\u2019s leadership, AlphaFold was reconstructed. DeepMind designed a new type of transformer architecture \u2014 a type of deep learning that has \u201cpowered basically every single machine learning breakthrough that\u2019s happened in the last five years,\u201d Townshend said. The neural network tweaked the strength of its connections to create more accurate representations of the data, in this case protein evolutionary and structure data. It ran that data through a second transformer to predict the 3D structure of a protein. The algorithm then honed the structure further by running it, together with some of the revised data, back through its transformers a few more times.\n\n![Image 28](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/A_Transformative_Architecture-crMarkBelan-srcDiveIntoDeepLearning-Desktop-v1-05.svg)\n\nMark Belan for _Quanta Magazine_\n\nWhen they first started working on AlphaFold2, their algorithm was \u201cterrible, but not as terrible as we expected,\u201d Jumper said. \u201c[It] made helices that kind of vaguely looked like a protein.\u201d But as they honed it further, they noticed enormous increases in the efficiency and accuracy of their predictions.\n\n\u201cIt was actually terrifying,\u201d Jumper said. If it\u2019s working too well, that usually means \u201cyou\u2019re doing the wrong thing.\u201d They checked, but there wasn\u2019t a problem. It was simply working.\n\nThe team decided to run an internal experiment to see whether their system would be helpful to biologists. They identified roughly 50 papers published in high-end journals like _Science_, _Nature_ and _Cell_ that not only described a new protein structure but also generated insights about the protein\u2019s function from the structure. They wanted to see if AlphaFold2 would stand up to the experimentalists\u2019 laborious approach.\n\nThey entered the amino acid sequences. AlphaFold2 ran its prediction engine. For each sequence, it spat out a prediction close to the experimental structure presented in the papers. However, in the team\u2019s view, it wasn\u2019t accurate enough. The structures were missing key details that the experimentalists learned about their proteins. \u201cYou feel like you\u2019ve finished the race and it\u2019s like finding out that you\u2019ve got the second half,\u201d Jumper said.\n\nThe team further honed the system over the next six months, minor improvement by minor improvement. A few weeks before the protein candidates were released for the 2020 CASP competition, they performed another usefulness test. Jumper was satisfied. Google DeepMind submitted their predictions to CASP in the spring of 2020. And then they waited.\n\n**The Earthquake**\n------------------\n\nIn early summer, Moult received an email from a CASP assessor: \u201cLook at this, it\u2019s pretty impressive.\u201d Attached to the email was a protein structure solved by Google DeepMind. Moult was indeed impressed, but he thought it was a one-off.\n\n![Image 29](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/03.png)\n\nThen he got another email, and another. \u201cThat\u2019s strange,\u201d he recalled thinking. There were three, four, a whole slew of near-perfect protein predictions \u2014 and all from DeepMind. By the end of the summer, \u201cwe rapidly realized \u2026 something very, very extraordinary had happened,\u201d Moult said.\n\nCASP assessors score each submission by comparing the predicted protein structure to its proven experimental structure. A perfect score, in which the model and reality match atom by atom, is 100. Moult had always believed that anything above 90 would indicate that an algorithm had effectively solved a protein\u2019s structure. Most of AlphaFold\u2019s structures hit or surpassed the 90 mark.\n\nA few months before the meeting, Moult called Jumper with the news. \u201cI cursed out loud,\u201d Jumper recalled. \u201cMy wife asked if I was OK.\u201d\n\nIn December 2020, less than a year into the Covid-19 pandemic, Jumper presented AlphaFold2 over Zoom at the virtual CASP meeting.\n\nLike the rest of the attendees, Jones watched from home. \u201cI was just stuck \u2026 watching this unfold,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no outlet because your colleagues aren\u2019t nearby. \u2026 We\u2019re all under lockdown so we can\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d\n\nFor anyone who wasn\u2019t a neural network expert, the ideas were complex. Even so, the conclusions were clear. DeepMind had solved the structure prediction part of the protein folding problem. AlphaFold2 could accurately predict the structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence.\n\n\u201cUgh, my favorite subject is dead,\u201d Jones recalled thinking. \u201cDeepMind shot it, and it\u2019s the end.\u201d\n\nFor years, Anastassis Perrakis had contributed unpublished experimental results to CASP for the competition. When he saw AlphaFold2\u2019s results for a protein his team had sweated over, he thought, \u201cUh-oh.\u201d AlphaFold2 had gotten it perfectly right.\n\nAlone at home in lockdown, the scientists were united in thinking that the world of protein science had changed forever. As its inhabitants looked out across the new landscape, they had one question in mind: What now?\n\n![Image 30](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/medium-3.jpg)\n\n**Part 3**\n==========\n\n**Shock and Awe**\n-----------------\n\nStructural biology suddenly became unstructured.\n\nAt first there was \u201ca lot of soul searching,\u201d said Silvio Tosatto, who had competed in CASP since its earliest days. Some structural biologists feared their jobs would become obsolete. Others grew defensive and claimed that AlphaFold2 wasn\u2019t accurate.\n\nThe computational biologists who had been trying to solve this problem, some for decades, found the moment bittersweet. In a blog post he wrote after CASP, AlQuraishi cited an attendee who described feeling like someone whose [child had left home](https://moalquraishi.wordpress.com/2020/12/08/alphafold2-casp14-it-feels-like-ones-child-has-left-home/) for the first time.\n\n![Image 31](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MohammedAlQuraishi-crNicolePereira-copy.webp)\n\nMohammed AlQuraishi, a systems biologist at Columbia University\u2019s Program for Mathematical Genomics, hopes that deep learning will be able to simulate an entire cell and all the structures and dynamics within it by 2040.\n\nNicole Pereira\n\nBut even amid their trepidation around this shiny new tool, many scientists were ecstatic. Those who didn\u2019t do structural work used to have to collaborate with structural biologists to determine protein structures for their broader experiments. Now, they could just press a few buttons and get the structure on their own.\n\nIn the media, AlphaFold2 became the shiny new artificial intelligence breakthrough that would \u201c[change everything](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03348-4).\u201d But it took months and years for scientists to tease apart what AlphaFold2 could and couldn\u2019t do. Around six months after Jumper\u2019s talk, Google DeepMind published their results and shared AlphaFold2\u2019s underlying code. \u201cWhen AlphaFold2 was out, the next day we were trying to install it in our GPU servers,\u201d Perrakis said. Biologists began to play.\n\n\u201cI expected [AlphaFold2] to fall down,\u201d Thornton said. \u201cBut actually my impression is that it\u2019s been remarkably successful.\u201d\n\n![Image 32](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AnastassisPerrakis-coAnastassisPerrakis.webp)\n\nAnastassis Perrakis contributed experimental protein structures to CASP on which computational biologists tested their methods. \u201cI was loving seeing [the methods] fail,\u201d he joked. \u201cIt\u2019s not rivalry, but we like to tease each other in science.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Anastassis Perrakis\n\nIt started to become clear that rather than being a threat, AlphaFold2 might be a catalyst for accelerating research. Rather than put structural biologists out of a job, it gave them a new tool to do their jobs better. \u201cIf you view a structural biologist simply as a technical specialist who works out the structure of proteins, then yes, of course structural biologists are out of the job,\u201d Walden said. But that would be like saying that the Human Genome Project made genomicists obsolete because they could no longer publish a paper describing the sequence of a single gene.\n\nIn many cases, a structural biologist\u2019s goal is to discover the function of a protein. With AlphaFold2, they could create a hypothesis within minutes rather than wait for months or years to work out a structure through experiments.\n\n\u201cThis changes structural biology in many good ways, and not bad ways,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThis only makes this a more exciting field to work in.\u201d\n\nHowever, it didn\u2019t immediately result in all kinds of new drugs as some people had predicted \u2014 and researchers soon learned that the tool has its limitations. AlphaFold2 predictions aren\u2019t perfect. They require experimental validation, Perrakis said. But \u201cyou can move much quicker to the actual study of the structures.\u201d Now when his students start a new project, they first use AlphaFold2 to predict the structure of a particular protein. Then they conduct experiments to validate it.\n\nPerrakis suspects that he and other researchers will continue to use X-ray crystallography to a degree. But to develop initial protein structures, many are starting to combine deep learning predictions with advanced electron microscope techniques such as cryo-EM, which involves flash-freezing biological samples and bombarding them with electrons. Then they can get to the interesting questions about what their proteins do. AlphaFold2 has \u201cturbo-boosted\u201d cryo-EM, AlQuraishi said.\n\n![Image 33](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Quanta_Protein-Folding_2024_Mobile-v2_How_Cryo_Electron_Microscopy_Works-crMarkBelan-Mobile-v2.svg)![Image 34](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Quanta_Protein-Folding_2024_Desktop-v2_How_Cryo_Electron_Microscopy_Works-crMarkBelan-Desktop-v2.svg)\n\nMark Belan for _Quanta Magazine_\n\nThat shift has already begun. In June 2022, a [special issue of _Science_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.add2210) revealed the near-atomic structure of a human nuclear pore complex. This massive, complicated structure \u2014 built of 30 different proteins \u2014 had been a biological quandary for decades. The scientists used AlphaFold2 predictions to fill in gaps in the proteins\u2019 structures left unsolved by cryo-EM.\n\nSeeing that paper, in which other scientists used AlphaFold2 to make a biological breakthrough, was the \u201cmoment that I knew that [AlphaFold] really, really mattered,\u201d Jumper said.\n\nDiscoveries like the nuclear pore complex dot the timeline of the last three years of protein science. Already, AlphaFold2 has predicted protein structures that have been used to study diseases and create new tools for drug delivery. \u201cIt\u2019s been hugely helpful for us,\u201d said [Feng Zhang](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/feng-zhang), a molecular biologist at the Broad Institute who used AlphaFold2 to engineer a molecular syringe to deliver drugs into human cells. Knowing a protein\u2019s structure can also help develop drugs if researchers can identify molecules to latch onto a protein\u2019s shape, for example, and change its behavior. While some studies have suggested that AlphaFold2 predictions aren\u2019t as useful as experimental structures in this realm, others have shown that [they work just as well](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adn6354). The full impact of AI tools on drug discovery is still unfolding.\n\nSome biologists, however, are already looking beyond AlphaFold2\u2019s use in discerning the structures and functions of known proteins and toward designing ones that don\u2019t exist in nature \u2014 a technique pivotal for designing novel medicines.\n\n**The Next Frontier**\n---------------------\n\nAlmost immediately after seeing Jumper\u2019s talk at the 2020 CASP conference, Baker got back to work on his Rosetta algorithm. Google hadn\u2019t yet shared AlphaFold2\u2019s underlying source code. Still, \u201cwe started playing with some of the ideas that they introduced,\u201d Baker said. On the same day that Google DeepMind [published AlphaFold2](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2) in _Nature_, he and his team [announced RoseTTAFold](https://www.bakerlab.org/2021/07/15/accurate-protein-structure-prediction-accessible/), a highly accurate rival to AlphaFold. RoseTTAFold also uses deep learning to predict protein structures but has a very different underlying architecture than AlphaFold2.\n\n\u201cOnce the scientific idea is out there, it\u2019s possible for people, at least the ones who have enough resources, to reverse engineer it and try to build on top of that,\u201d Tosatto said.\n\nRoseTTAFold wasn\u2019t alone. Other AlphaFold competitors, including Meta, crafted their own algorithms to address protein structure prediction or related problems. Some, including Townshend\u2019s biotech startup Atomic AI, have expanded beyond proteins to use deep learning to understand RNA structures. However, in the realm of single-structure predictions, no one has been able to match AlphaFold\u2019s accuracy so far, Thornton said. \u201cI\u2019m sure they will, but I think getting another \u2026 AlphaFold moment like that will be very difficult.\u201d\n\n![Image 35: David Baker stands at a podium.](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DavidBaker-crBBVAFoundation-01-scaled.webp)\n\nLast year, David Baker (pictured here), with John Jumper and Demis Hassabis, received the Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Biology and Biomedicine for their work revolutionizing the study and design of proteins with artificial intelligence.\n\nBBVA Foundation\n\nAt least in public, Baker and Jumper have continued the tradition of productive competition established by CASP. \u201cThey might feel that I compete with them, but I feel like they\u2019ve just been inspirational for us,\u201d Baker said.\n\nJumper welcomes it. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that people build on this science,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be sad to me if there was no intellectual lineage of AlphaFold.\u201d\n\nBaker is already evolving his program\u2019s lineage to focus on a new frontier in protein science: protein design. Right now, biologists are confined to studying the proteins already invented by nature. Baker envisions a science in which they could design novel proteins \u2014 ones crafted specifically to harness sunlight, break down plastic, or form the basis of drugs or vaccines.\n\n\u201cThe number of different types of protein structures or shapes in nature at the moment is quite limited,\u201d said [Danny Sahtoe](https://www.hubrecht.eu/research-groups/sahtoe-group/), a structural biologist at the Hubrecht Institute in the Netherlands who did his postdoc under Baker. \u201cIn theory, more should be possible, and if you can have more shapes, that also means that you can have more functions.\u201d\n\nProtein design is essentially the \u201cinverse protein folding problem,\u201d said Baker, who directs the [Institute for Protein Design](https://www.bakerlab.org/) at the University of Washington. Rather than feed an amino acid sequence to a deep learning algorithm and ask it to spit out a protein structure, a protein designer feeds a structure into an algorithm and asks it to spit out a sequence. Then, using that amino acid sequence, the designer builds the protein in the lab.\n\nAlphaFold and RoseTTAFold by themselves can\u2019t spit out these sequences; they are programmed to do the opposite. But Baker created a design-specific iteration of RoseTTAFold, known as RoseTTAFold diffusion or [RF diffusion](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06415-8), based on its neural architecture.\n\nThe field of protein design has existed for a long time, but deep learning has accelerated it, Sahtoe said. It makes the process of designing realistic computer models of proteins \u201cincredibly fast.\u201d It used to take weeks or months for trained protein designers to create the backbone of a new protein. Now they can make one in days, sometimes even overnight.\n\n![Image 36](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/FoldIt_Screenshot-crNONE-2.webp)\n\n[Foldit](https://fold.it/), an online game developed by Baker\u2019s lab, has players predict protein structures.\n\nBaker also updated Foldit to incorporate his obsession: Instead of building protein structures, players design proteins. It\u2019s been productive. Baker\u2019s lab has written papers on several of the player-designed proteins. One of the world\u2019s top Foldit players is now a graduate student working with one of Baker\u2019s colleagues at the University of Washington.\n\n\u201cDo we understand protein folding? Well, if we can design new sequences that fold up to new structures, then that shows we understand quite a lot about protein folding,\u201d Baker said. \u201cThat, in a sense, you could view as a solution to the protein folding problem too.\u201d\n\n**Trust Exercise**\n------------------\n\nAlphaFold2\u2019s success has undeniably shifted biologists\u2019 attitudes toward artificial intelligence. For a long time, many experimental biologists distrusted computation. They understood that some machine learning approaches can make data appear better than it is. Then Google DeepMind demonstrated \u201cunequivocally that you could do serious work with this,\u201d AlQuraishi said. Any skepticism is now matched with: \u201cWell, what about AlphaFold?\u201d\n\n![Image 37](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/06.png)\n\n\u201cBiologists now believe our prediction results,\u201d said Xu, the computational biologist who advanced convolutional networks. \u201cBefore, biologists always suspected if our prediction is reliable.\u201d\n\nPlaying into this trust is a feature of the AlphaFold2 platform: It not only generates a 3D model of a protein, but also self-assesses the accuracy of its prediction by grading different parts of the structure on a confidence scale from zero to 100.\n\nIn July 2022, after Google DeepMind [released the structure predictions](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/) of 218 million proteins \u2014 nearly all those known in the world \u2014 Adams decided to analyze AlphaFold2\u2019s self-reports. He compared the predictions to the proteins\u2019 solved structures and independently assessed their accuracy.\n\nThe \u201cgood news is that when AlphaFold thinks that it\u2019s right, it often is very right,\u201d Adams said. \u201cWhen it thinks it\u2019s not right, it generally isn\u2019t.\u201d However, in about 10% of the instances in which AlphaFold2 was \u201cvery confident\u201d about its prediction (a score of at least 90 out of 100 on the confidence scale), it shouldn\u2019t have been, he reported: The predictions didn\u2019t match what was seen experimentally.\n\nThat the AI system seems to have some self-skepticism may inspire an overreliance on its conclusions. Most biologists see AlphaFold2 for what it is: a prediction tool. But others are taking it too far. Some cell biologists and biochemists who used to work with structural biologists have replaced them with AlphaFold2 \u2014 and take its predictions as truth. Sometimes scientists publish papers featuring protein structures that, to any structural biologist, are obviously incorrect, Perrakis said. \u201cAnd they say: \u2018Well, that\u2019s the AlphaFold structure.\u2019\u201d\n\n![Image 38](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/LaurenPorter-coLaurenPorter-scaled.webp)\n\nAt the National Institutes of Health, Lauren Porter studies proteins that can change conformations, called fold-switching proteins. They \u201cchallenge the paradigm that sequences encode one structure,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause clearly they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Lauren Porter\n\n\u201cSome people are overconfident \u2014 like, way overconfident \u2014 in what these deep learning models can do,\u201d said [Lauren Porter](https://irp.nih.gov/pi/lauren-porter), an investigator at the National Institutes of Health. \u201cWe should use these deep learning models for as much as we can, but we also need to approach them with caution and humility.\u201d\n\nJones has heard of scientists struggling to get funding to determine structures computationally. \u201cThe general perception is that DeepMind did it, you know, and why are you still doing it?\u201d Jones said. But that work is still necessary, he argues, because AlphaFold2 is fallible.\n\n\u201cThere are very large gaps,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere are things that it can\u2019t do quite clearly.\u201d\n\nWhile AlphaFold2 is excellent at predicting the structures of small, simple proteins, it\u2019s less accurate at predicting those containing multiple parts. It also can\u2019t account for the protein\u2019s environment or bonds with other molecules, which alter a protein\u2019s shape in the wild. Sometimes a protein needs to be surrounded by certain ions, salts or metals to fold properly.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, AlphaFold is a little bit of a ways away from being able to determine context,\u201d Walden said. Her group has determined several structures experimentally that AlphaFold2 couldn\u2019t predict.\n\nThere are also several types of dynamic proteins that AlphaFold2 predicts poorly but that are no less important in function. Shape-shifting proteins, also known as fold-switching proteins, are not static: [Their shapes change](https://www.quantamagazine.org/metamorphic-proteins-change-their-folds-for-different-jobs-20210203/) as they interact with other molecules. Some fold into dramatically different shapes, despite having the same amino acid sequence. Fold-switching proteins \u201cchallenge the paradigm that sequences encode one structure,\u201d Porter said, \u201cbecause clearly they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFold-switching proteins like RfaH, shown here, can change conformations to perform different tasks. When in its alpha helix form, the RfAH protein can\u2019t bind to its target \u2014 but when it switches its form to a beta sheet, it can.\n\nCourtesy of Lauren Porter\n\nCompared to the hundreds of thousands of static, single-structure proteins that the DeepMind algorithm trained on, there are only about 100 examples of fold-switching proteins \u2014 although more surely exist. It\u2019s perhaps no surprise, Porter said, that \u201cgenerally speaking, these algorithms were made to predict a single fold.\u201d\n\nAnd then there are the proteins that flail about like an air dancer outside a car dealership. Intrinsically disordered proteins or protein regions [lack a stable structure](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-disordered-proteins-are-upending-molecular-biology-20170118/). They wiggle and re-form constantly. \u201cThey\u2019ve been in many ways ignored simply because they were a little bit annoying,\u201d said [Kresten Lindorff-Larsen](https://www1.bio.ku.dk/english/research/bms/sbinlab/kll/), a professor of computational protein biophysics at the University of Copenhagen. Around 44% of human proteins have a disordered region made up of at least 30 amino acids. \u201cIt\u2019s a relatively large fraction of them,\u201d Lindorff-Larsen said.\n\nWe should use deep learning models for as much as we can, but we also need to approach them with caution and humility.\n\nLauren Porter, National Institutes of Health\n\nAlphaFold2 can predict when a region is likely to be intrinsically disordered \u2014 but it can\u2019t tell you what that disorder looks like.\n\nFor his part, Jumper\u2019s biggest frustration is that AlphaFold2 doesn\u2019t register the difference between two proteins that vary by a single amino acid, known as a point mutation. Point mutations can \u201chave quite dramatic effects, sometimes on structure and often on function of proteins,\u201d he said. \u201cAlphaFold is relatively blind\u201d to them, in that it will produce the same structure for both sequences.\n\nIn September 2023 DeepMind released [AlphaMissense](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg7492), a deep learning algorithm that predicts the effects of such mutations. It can\u2019t show the change to the structure, but it informs the user if the mutation might turn the protein pathogenic or introduce dysfunction based on similar mutations in known pathogenic proteins.\n\nHowever, even if AlphaFold2 could predict all proteins perfectly, it would be far from modeling biological reality. That\u2019s because in a cell, proteins never act alone.\n\n**Cellular Complexity**\n-----------------------\n\nThe insides of cells are complicated and chaotic. A cell\u2019s external membrane envelops a biochemical environment densely crowded with molecular parts \u2014 proteins, signaling molecules, messenger RNA, organelles and more. Proteins bind to each other and to other molecules, which alters their forms and functions.\n\n![Image 39](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EukaryoticLandscape-crEvanIngersollAndGaelMcGillPhD_DigizymeInc-v2.webp)\n\nProteins don\u2019t work alone: They interact constantly with other molecules. This rendering of a cellular landscape is made of models of real proteins and other molecules in \u201can attempt to visualize the great complexity and beauty of the cell\u2019s molecular choreography,\u201d wrote its creator, [Gael McGill](https://gaelmcgill.artstation.com/projects/Pm0JL1).\n\nEvan Ingersoll and Ga\u00ebl McGill, PhD/Digizyme Inc\n\nAlphaFold2\u2019s ability to predict the structure of a single protein doesn\u2019t get biologists close to understanding proteins in this intricate native environment. But that\u2019s the direction the field is now heading. Protein science\u2019s artificial intelligence giants, Google DeepMind and David Baker\u2019s Institute for Protein Design, are now evolving their deep learning algorithms to predict the structures that proteins assume while interacting with other molecules.\n\nIn spring 2024, they both published papers [describing similar developments](https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-ai-tools-predict-how-lifes-building-blocks-assemble-20240508/) in this area. Updates to their algorithms \u2014 launched with the new names AlphaFold3 and RoseTTAFold All-Atom \u2014 enable them to predict the structures of proteins bound to each other, DNA, RNA and other small molecules.\n\nBiologists are just starting to test out these updates. So far, AlphaFold3 is much more accurate than RoseTTAFold All-Atom, AlQuraishi said \u2014 but it\u2019s not as big of a leap as an \u201cAlphaFold2 moment.\u201d For some macromolecules, such as RNA structures, its accuracy remains below that of other physics-based systems and experiments.\n\nAlphaFold3 predicts the structures of molecular complexes, such as this enzyme found in a plant-damaging fungus. In this model structure, the protein (blue) is linked to simple sugars (yellow) and an ion (yellow sphere).\n\nGoogle DeepMind\n\nEven so, the new algorithms are a step in the right direction. The interactions between proteins and other molecules are critical to their functioning in cells. To develop drugs that can dock onto proteins and alter their activity as desired, researchers need to understand what those complexes look like. It\u2019s unlikely, though, that either algorithm will lead to new medicines anytime soon, Adams said. \u201cBoth methods are still limited in their accuracy, [but] both are dramatic improvements on what was possible.\u201d\n\nThere is one other major change in DeepMind\u2019s new product. AlphaFold2\u2019s underlying code was open-source so that other researchers could study the algorithm and remake it for their own projects. However, rather than share AlphaFold3\u2019s source code, Google has so far opted to protect it as a trade secret. \u201cFor the time being, at least, no one can run and use it like they did with [AlphaFold2],\u201d AlQuraishi said.\n\n![Image 40](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/BrendaRubenstein-crMelissaShein-scaled.webp)\n\nThe chemist and physicist Brenda Rubenstein figured out how to use AlphaFold2 creatively to predict multiple conformations of the protein she studies at Brown University.\n\nMelissa Shein\n\nEven before the release of AlphaFold3, researchers had been testing AlphaFold2 to see if it could provide useful information on proteins in different conformations. [Brenda Rubenstein](https://rubenstein.group/), an associate professor of chemistry and physics at Brown University, was interested in kinases, a type of protein that activates other proteins. Specifically, she wanted to understand the mechanism of a kinase that causes cancer so that she could develop more precise drugs against it. Her lab modeled the kinase\u2019s structure using a physics-based approach, which maps the 3D coordinates of atoms using Newton\u2019s laws. It took two and a half years.\n\n\u201cAbout a year ago, we said: Can we do this faster?\u201d Rubenstein said. They tried using AlphaFold2 in a novel way. By feeding data about related proteins to the algorithm, she found that it could [predict her kinase](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46715-9) in different conformations with more than 80% accuracy.\n\nRubenstein\u2019s is one of several labs finding that \u201cif you poke AlphaFold in the right way, you get it to kind of spit out alternate conformations,\u201d AlQuraishi said. \u201cThat\u2019s been encouraging.\u201d\n\nAlQuraishi hopes that by 2040, deep learning will be able to simulate an entire cell and all the structures and dynamics within it. Getting there, however, will require leaps on both the experimental and computational sides.\n\n**An Outsider\u2019s Take**\n----------------------\n\nFor many biologists, AlphaFold2 was the breakthrough they had been waiting for. The goal of CASP had been to create computing tools that predict protein structure from sequence. Still, many can\u2019t help but ask: Why was a relative newcomer able to crack the protein code when so many experts had struggled for decades?\n\nThe insights that Google DeepMind\u2019s team of computer and protein scientists brought to the problem are undeniable. At the same time, the ground of protein science was fertile and ready to yield a deep learning revolution, AlQuraishi said. \u201cThese things don\u2019t appear out of nowhere.\u201d\n\nThe ground of protein science was fertile and ready to yield a deep learning revolution.\n\nBy the time CASP 2020 came around, many researchers expected a breakthrough in structure prediction to come through artificial intelligence. \u201cIt was all heading in that direction,\u201d Townshend said. But they didn\u2019t expect it to come from a multibillion-dollar technology company, and they didn\u2019t expect it so soon. Some said AlphaFold2 wasn\u2019t a feat of new science but rather clever engineering. Some were surprised that David Baker\u2019s algorithms didn\u2019t take the trophy. Others were less surprised because of Google DeepMind\u2019s unmatched resources.\n\nAround 100 labs participate in CASP every year, and though they had begun to adopt AI technologies, they \u201cprobably didn\u2019t have the expertise that DeepMind had, nor the computing power,\u201d Thornton said. DeepMind \u201chad access to basically unlimited computing power.\u201d\n\nShe also speculated that Google\u2019s lack of expertise in protein science may have freed them creatively. \u201cThey were single-minded,\u201d Thornton said, and focused on building a great neural network. Protein biologists had baggage. As they worked on their AI tools, they wanted to capture the atomic-level molecular physics and chemistry involved in protein folding. DeepMind had a different approach: We will transform sequence data into a 3D structure, and it doesn\u2019t matter how we get there.\n\n\u201cRather than trying to solve the protein folding problem, which I think a lot of previous predictions tried to do, they actually just went with the brute force\u201d of mapping out the atoms\u2019 final positions in space, Walden said. \u201cRather interestingly, they have therefore probably solved the problem.\u201d\n\n![Image 41](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EllenZhong-crToriRepp_FotobuddyForPrincetonUniversity-scaled.webp)\n\nThe Princeton University computer scientist Ellen Zhong, who was an intern on Google DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold2 team in 2021, pioneered the use of deep learning in combination with cryo-EM to study protein dynamics.\n\nTori Repp/Fotobuddy for Princeton University\n\nTo some biologists, that approach leaves the protein folding problem incomplete. From the earliest days of structural biology, researchers hoped to learn the rules of how an amino acid string folds into a protein. With AlphaFold2, most biologists agree that the structure prediction problem is solved. However, the protein folding problem is not. \u201cRight now, you just have this black box that can somehow tell you the folded states, but not actually how you get there,\u201d Zhong said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not solved the way a scientist would solve it,\u201d said Littman, the Brown University computer scientist.\n\nThis might sound like \u201csemantic quibbling,\u201d said George Rose, the biophysics professor emeritus at Johns Hopkins. \u201cBut of course it isn\u2019t.\u201d AlphaFold2 can recognize patterns in how a given amino acid sequence might fold up based on its analysis of hundreds of thousands of protein structures. But it can\u2019t tell scientists anything about the protein folding process.\n\n\u201cFor many people, you don\u2019t need to know. They don\u2019t care,\u201d Rose said. \u201cBut science, at least for the past 500 years or so \u2026 has been involved with trying to understand the process by which things occur.\u201d To understand the dynamics, mechanisms, functions and nature of protein-based life, Rose argued, you need the full story \u2014 one that deep learning algorithms can\u2019t tell us.\n\nRight now, you have this black box that can somehow tell you the folded states, but not actually how you get there.\n\nEllen Zhong, Princeton University\n\nTo Moult, it doesn\u2019t matter that the machine does something he doesn\u2019t understand. \u201cWe\u2019re all used to machines doing things we can\u2019t. You know, I can\u2019t run as fast as my car,\u201d he said. To molecular biologists who are trying to study a protein and just need to know roughly what it looks like, how they get there doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\nBut \u201cuntil we know really how it works, we\u2019re never going to have a 100% reliable predictor,\u201d Porter said. \u201cWe have to understand the fundamental physics to be able to make the most informed predictions we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe keep moving the goalpost,\u201d AlQuraishi said. \u201cI do think that core problem has been solved, so now it\u2019s very much about what comes next.\u201d\n\nEven as biologists continue to debate these topics, others are looking forward to a field that\u2019s undeniably changed \u2014 and backward toward its recent past.\n\nSometimes Perrakis is hit by a wave of nostalgia for the old ways of doing things. In 2022, his team [described an enzyme](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abn6020) involved in modifying microtubules (giant, rod-shaped molecules that provide structures to cells) that they had determined using X-ray crystallography. \u201cI realized that I\u2019m never going to do that [again],\u201d he said. \u201cHaving the first structure appearing after months of work was a very particular satisfaction.\u201d\n\nAlphaFold2 hasn\u2019t made those experiments obsolete. On the contrary, it\u2019s illuminated just how necessary they are. It has stitched together two historically disparate disciplines, launching a new and stimulating conversation.\n\n**The New World**\n-----------------\n\nSeventy years ago, proteins were thought to be a gelatinous substance, Porter said. \u201cNow look at what we can see\u201d: structure after structure of a vast world of proteins, whether they exist in nature or were designed.\n\n[New AI Tools Predict How Life\u2019s Building Blocks Assemble ![Image 42: An illustration shows a many-armed computer, like an octopus, that is assembling a molecular structure using balls of many different colors.](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AI_Biomolecule-byAdamNickel-Default.webp)](https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-ai-tools-predict-how-lifes-building-blocks-assemble-20240508/)\n\n[molecular biology](https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/molecular-biology/)\n\n[### New AI Tools Predict How Life\u2019s Building Blocks Assemble](https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-ai-tools-predict-how-lifes-building-blocks-assemble-20240508/)\n\nMay 8, 2024\n\n[](https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-ai-tools-predict-how-lifes-building-blocks-assemble-20240508/#comments)\n\nRead Later\n\nThe field of protein biology is \u201cmore exciting right now than it was before AlphaFold,\u201d Perrakis said. The excitement comes from the promise of reviving structure-based drug discovery, the acceleration in creating hypotheses and the hope of understanding complex interactions happening within cells.\n\n\u201cIt [feels] like the genomics revolution,\u201d AlQuraishi said. There is so much data, and biologists, whether in their wet labs or in front of their computers, are just starting to figure out what to do with it all.\n\nBut like other artificial intelligence breakthroughs sparking across the world, this one might have a ceiling.\n\nAlphaFold2\u2019s success was founded on the availability of training data \u2014 hundreds of thousands of protein structures meticulously determined by the hands of patient experimentalists. While AlphaFold3 and related algorithms have shown some success in determining the structures of molecular compounds, their accuracy lags behind that of their single-protein predecessors. That\u2019s in part because there is significantly less training data available.\n\nThe protein folding problem was \u201calmost a perfect example for an AI solution,\u201d Thornton said, because the algorithm could train on hundreds of thousands of protein structures collected in a uniform way. However, the Protein Data Bank may be an unusual example of organized data sharing in biology. Without high-quality data to train algorithms, they won\u2019t make accurate predictions.\n\n\u201cWe got lucky,\u201d Jumper said. \u201cWe met the problem at the time it was ready to be solved.\u201d\n\n![Image 43](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/01.png)\n\nNo one knows if deep learning\u2019s success at addressing the protein folding problem will carry over to other fields of science, or even other areas of biology. But some, like AlQuraishi, are optimistic. \u201cProtein folding is really just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d he said. Chemists, for example, need to perform computationally expensive calculations. With deep learning, these calculations are already being computed up to a million times faster than before, AlQuraishi said.\n\nArtificial intelligence can clearly advance specific kinds of scientific questions. But it may get scientists only so far in advancing knowledge. \u201cHistorically, science has been about understanding nature,\u201d AlQuraishi said \u2014 the processes that underlie life and the universe. If science moves forward with deep learning tools that reveal solutions and no process, is it really science?\n\n\u201cIf you can cure cancer, do you care about how it really works?\u201d AlQuraishi said. \u201cIt is a question that we\u2019re going to wrestle with for years to come.\u201d\n\nIf many researchers decide to give up on understanding nature\u2019s processes, then artificial intelligence will not just have changed science \u2014 it will have changed the scientists too.\n\nMeanwhile, the CASP organizers are wrestling with a different question: how to continue their competition and conference. AlphaFold2 is a product of CASP, and it solved the main problem the conference was organized to address. \u201cIt was a big shock for us in terms of: Just what is CASP anymore?\u201d Moult said.\n\nIn 2022, the CASP meeting was held in Antalya, Turkey. Google DeepMind didn\u2019t enter, but the team\u2019s presence was felt. \u201cIt was more or less just people using AlphaFold,\u201d Jones said. In that sense, he said, Google won anyway.\n\nRelated:\n--------\n\n* * *\n\n1.   ### [Does AI Know What an Apple Is?

Others continue to hone their algorithms. Jones still dabbles in structure prediction, but it\u2019s more of a hobby for him now. Others, like AlQuraishi and Baker, continue on by developing new algorithms for structure prediction and design, undaunted by the prospect of competing against a multibillion-dollar company.\n\nMoult and the conference organizers are trying to evolve. The next round of CASP opened for entries in May. He is hoping that deep learning will conquer more areas of structural biology, like RNA or biomolecular complexes. \u201cThis method worked on this one problem,\u201d Moult said. \u201cThere are lots of other related problems in structural biology.\u201d\n\nThe next meeting will be held in December 2024 by the aqua waters of the Caribbean Sea. The winds are cordial, as the conversation will probably be. The stamping has long since died down \u2014 at least out loud. What this year\u2019s competition will look like is anyone\u2019s guess. But if the past few CASPs are any indication, Moult knows to expect only one thing: \u201csurprises.\u201d\n\n![Image

Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold.

AlphaFold2 and its applications in the fields of biology and medicine. Signal Transduct. Target. Ther. 8, 115 (2023).\"). Here we describe our AlphaFold\u20093 model with a substantially updated diffusion-based architecture that is capable of predicting the joint structure of complexes including proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, ions and modified residues. The new AlphaFold model demonstrates substantially improved accuracy over many previous specialized tools: far greater accuracy for protein\u2013ligand interactions compared with state-of-the-art docking tools, much higher accuracy for protein\u2013nucleic acid interactions compared with nucleic-acid-specific predictors and substantially higher antibody\u2013antigen prediction accuracy compared with AlphaFold-Multimer v.2.3[7](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR7 \"Evans, R. et al.

Generalized biomolecular modeling and design with RoseTTAFold All-Atom. Science 384, eadl2528 (2024).\"), but the accuracy of such deep-learning attempts has been mixed and often below that of physics-inspired methods[30](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR30 \"Buttenschoen, M., Morris, G. M. & Deane, C. M. PoseBusters: AI-based docking methods fail to generate physically valid poses or generalise to novel sequences. Chem.

Proteins 91, 1747\u20131770 (2023).\"). Almost all of these methods are also highly specialized to particular interaction types and cannot predict the structure of general biomolecular complexes containing many types of entities.\n\nHere we present AlphaFold\u20093 (AF3)\u2014a model that is capable of high-accuracy prediction of complexes containing nearly all molecular types present in the Protein Data Bank[32](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR32 \"Berman, H. M. et al. The Protein Data Bank. Nucleic Acids Res. 28, 235\u2013242 (2000).\") (PDB) (Fig. [1a,b](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig1)). In all but one category, it achieves a substantially higher performance than strong methods that specialize in just the given task (Fig. [1c](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig1) and Extended Data Table [1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Tab1)), including higher accuracy at protein structure and the structure of protein\u2013protein interactions.\n\nThis is achieved by a substantial evolution of the AF2 architecture and training procedure (Fig. [1d](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig1)) both to accommodate more general chemical structures and to improve the data efficiency of learning. The system reduces the amount of multiple-sequence alignment (MSA) processing by replacing the AF2 evoformer with the simpler pairformer module (Fig. [2a](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig2)). Furthermore it directly predicts the raw atom coordinates with a diffusion module, replacing the AF2 structure module that operated on amino-acid-specific frames and side-chain torsion angles (Fig. [2b](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig2)). The multiscale nature of the diffusion process (low noise levels induce the network to improve local structure) also enable us to eliminate stereochemical losses and most special handling of bonding patterns in the network, easily accommodating arbitrary chemical components.\n\n## Network architecture and training\n\nThe overall structure of AF3 (Fig. [1d](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig1) and Supplementary Methods\u00a0[3](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)) echoes that of AF2, with a large trunk evolving a pairwise representation of the chemical complex followed by a structure module that uses the pairwise representation to generate explicit atomic positions, but there are large differences in each major component. These modifications were driven both by the need to accommodate a wide range of chemical entities without excessive special casing and by observations of AF2 performance with different modifications. Within the trunk, MSA processing is substantially de-emphasized, with a much smaller and simpler MSA embedding block (Supplementary Methods\u00a0[3.3](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)). Compared with the original evoformer from AF2, the number of blocks is reduced to four, the processing of the MSA representation uses an inexpensive pair-weighted averaging and only the pair representation is used for later processing steps. The \u2018pairformer\u2019 (Fig. [2a](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig2) and Supplementary Methods\u00a0[3.6](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)) replaces the evoformer of AF2 as the dominant processing block. It operates only on the pair representation and the single representation; the MSA representation is not retained and all information passes through the pair representation. The pair processing and the number of blocks (48) is largely unchanged from AF2. The resulting pair and single representation together with the input representation are passed to the new diffusion module (Fig. [2b](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig2)) that replaces the structure module of AF2.\n\nThe diffusion module (Fig. [2b](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig2) and Supplementary Methods\u00a0[3.7](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)) operates directly on raw atom coordinates, and on a coarse abstract token representation, without rotational frames or any equivariant processing. We had observed in AF2 that removing most of the complexity of the structure module had only a modest effect on the prediction accuracy, and maintaining the backbone frame and side-chain torsion representation add quite a bit of complexity for general molecular graphs. Similarly AF2 required carefully tuned stereochemical violation penalties during training to enforce chemical plausibility of the resulting structures. We use a relatively standard diffusion approach[33](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR33 \"Karras, T., Aittala, M., Aila, T. & Laine, S. Elucidating the design space of diffusion-based generative models. Adv. Neural Inf. Process. Syst. 35, 26565\u201326577 (2022).\") in which the diffusion model is trained to receive \u2018noised\u2019 atomic coordinates and then predict the true coordinates. This task requires the network to learn protein structure at a variety of length scales, whereby the denoising task at small noise emphasizes understanding very local stereochemistry and the denoising task at high noise emphasizes the large-scale structure of the system. At the inference time, random noise is sampled and then recurrently denoised to produce a final structure. Importantly, this is a generative training procedure that produces a distribution of answers. This means that, for each answer, the local structure will be sharply defined (for example, side-chain bond geometry) even when the network is uncertain about the positions. For this reason, we are able to avoid both torsion-based parametrizations of the residues and violation losses on the structure, while handling the full complexity of general ligands. Similarly to some recent work[34](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR34 \"Wang, Y., Elhag, A. A., Jaitly, N., Susskind, J. M. & Bautista, M. A. Generating molecular conformer fields. Preprint at arXiv \n                  https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2311.17932\n                  \n                 (2023).\"), we find that no invariance or equivariance with respect to global rotations and translation of the molecule are required in the architecture and we therefore omit them to simplify the machine learning architecture.\n\nThe use of a generative diffusion approach comes with some technical challenges that we needed to address. The biggest issue is that generative models are prone to hallucination[35](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR35 \"Ji, Z., et al. Survey of hallucination in natural language generation. ACM Comput. Surv. 55, 248 (2023).\"), whereby the model may invent plausible-looking structure even in unstructured regions. To counteract this effect, we use a cross-distillation method in which we enrich the training data with structures predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer (v.2.3)[7](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR7 \"Evans, R. et al. Protein complex prediction with AlphaFold-Multimer. Preprint at bioRxiv \n                  https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.04.463034\n                  \n                 (2022).\"),[8](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR8 \"\u017didek, A. AlphaFold v.2.3.0 Technical Note. GitHub \n                  https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold/blob/main/docs/technical_note_v2.3.0.md\n                  \n                 (2022).\"). In these structures, unstructured regions are typically represented by long extended loops instead of compact structures, and training on them \u2018teaches\u2019 AF3 to mimic this behaviour. This cross-distillation greatly reduced the hallucination behaviour of AF3 (Extended Data Fig. [1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig6) for disorder prediction results on the CAID 2[36](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR36 \"Del Conte, A. et al. Critical assessment of protein intrinsic disorder prediction (CAID)\u2014results of round 2. Proteins 91, 1925\u20131934 (2023).\") benchmark set).\n\nWe also developed confidence measures that predict the atom-level and pairwise errors in our final structures. In AF2, this was done directly by regressing the error in the output of the structure module during training. However, this procedure is not applicable to diffusion training, as only a single step of the diffusion is trained instead of a full-structure generation (Fig. [2c](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig2)). To remedy this, we developed a diffusion \u2018rollout\u2019 procedure for the full-structure prediction generation during training (using a larger step size than normal; Fig. [2c](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig2) (mini-rollout)). This predicted structure is then used to permute the symmetric ground-truth chains and ligands, and to compute the performance metrics to train the confidence head. The confidence head uses the pairwise representation to predict a modified local distance difference test (pLDDT) and a predicted aligned error (PAE) matrix as in AF2, as well as a distance error matrix (PDE), which is the error in the distance matrix of the predicted structure as compared to the true structure (details are provided in Supplementary Methods\u00a0[4.3](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)).\n\nFigure [2d](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig2) shows that, during initial training, the model learns quickly to predict the local structures (all intrachain metrics go up quickly and reach 97% of the maximum performance within the first 20,000 training steps), while the model needs considerably longer to learn the global constellation (the interface metrics go up slowly and protein\u2013protein interface LDDT passes the 97% bar only after 60,000 steps). During AF3 development, we observed that some model abilities topped out relatively early and started to decline (most likely due to overfitting to the limited number of training samples for this capability), while other abilities were still undertrained. We addressed this by increasing or decreasing the sampling probability for the corresponding training sets (Supplementary Methods\u00a0[2.5.1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)) and by performing early stopping using a weighted average of all of the above metrics and some additional metrics to select the best model checkpoint (Supplementary Table [7](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)). The fine-tuning stages with the larger crop sizes improve the model on all metrics with an especially high uplift on protein\u2013protein interfaces (Extended Data Fig. [2](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig7)).\n\n## Accuracy across complex types\n\nAF3 can predict structures from input polymer sequences, residue modifications and ligand SMILES\u00a0(simplified molecular-input line-entry system). In Fig. [3](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig3) we show a selection of examples highlighting the ability of the model to generalize to a number of biologically important and therapeutically relevant modalities. In selecting these examples, we considered novelty in terms of the similarity of individual chains and interfaces to the training set (additional information is provided in Supplementary Methods\u00a0[8.1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)).\n\nWe evaluated the performance of the system on recent interface-specific benchmarks for each complex type (Fig. [1c](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig1) and Extended Data Table [1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Tab1)). Performance on protein\u2013ligand interfaces was evaluated on the PoseBusters benchmark set, which is composed of 428 protein\u2013ligand structures released to the PDB in 2021 or later. As our standard training cut-off date is in 2021, we trained a separate AF3 model with an earlier training-set cutoff ([Methods](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Sec7)). Accuracy on the PoseBusters set is reported as the percentage of protein\u2013ligand pairs with pocket-aligned ligand root mean squared deviation (r.m.s.d.) of less than 2\u2009\u00c5. The baseline models come in two categories: those that use only protein sequence and ligand SMILES as an input and those that additionally leak information from the solved protein\u2013ligand test structure. Traditional docking methods use the latter privileged information, even though that information would not be available in real-world use cases. Even so, AF3 greatly outperforms classical docking tools such as Vina[37](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR37 \"Trott, O. & Olson, A. J. AutoDock Vina: improving the speed and accuracy of docking with a new scoring function, efficient optimization, and multithreading. J. Comput. Chem. 31, 455\u2013461 (2010).\"),[38](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR38 \"Miller, E. B. et al. Reliable and accurate solution to the induced fit docking problem for protein\u2013ligand binding.

Theory Comput. \n                  https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00136\n                  \n                 (2021).\") even while not using any structural inputs (Fisher\u2019s exact test, *P*\u2009=\u20092.27\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221213) and greatly outperforms all other true blind docking like RoseTTAFold All-Atom (*P*\u2009=\u20094.45\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221225). Extended Data Fig. [3](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig8) shows three examples in which AF3 achieves accurate predictions but docking tools Vina and Gold do not[37](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR37 \"Trott, O. & Olson, A. J. AutoDock Vina: improving the speed and accuracy of docking with a new scoring function, efficient optimization, and multithreading. J. Comput. Chem. 31, 455\u2013461 (2010).\"). PoseBusters analysis was performed using a training cut-off of 30 September 2019 for AF3 to ensure that the model was not trained on any PoseBusters structures. To compare with the RoseTTAFold All-Atom results, we used PoseBusters version 1. Version 2 (crystal contacts removed from the benchmark set) results including quality metrics are shown in Extended Data Fig. [4b\u2013f](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig9) and Extended Data Table [1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Tab1). We use multiple seeds to ensure correct chirality and avoid slight protein\u2013ligand clashing (as opposed to a method like diffusion guidance to enforce) but we are typically able to produce high-quality stereochemistry. Separately, we also train a version of AF3 that receives the \u2018pocket information\u2019 as used in some recent deep-learning work[24](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR24 \"Liao, Z. et al.

As RoseTTAFold2NA is validated only on structures below 1,000 residues, we use only structures below 1,000 residues from our recent PDB evaluation set for this comparison ([Methods](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Sec7)). AF3 is able to predict protein\u2013nucleic structures with thousands of residues, an example of which is shown in Fig. [3a](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig3). Note that we do not compare directly to RoseTTAFold All-Atom, but benchmarks indicate that RoseTTAFold All-Atom is slightly less accurate than RoseTTAFold2NA for nucleic acid predictions[29](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR29 \"Krishna, R. et al.

Owing to limited dataset sizes, we do not report significance test statistics here. Further analysis of the accuracy of predicting nucleic acids alone (without proteins) is shown in Extended Data Fig. [5b](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig10).\n\nCovalent modifications (bonded ligands, glycosylation, and modified protein residues and nucleic acid bases) are also accurately predicted by AF3 (Fig. [1c](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig1) (centre right)). Modifications include those to any polymer residue (protein, RNA or DNA). We report accuracy as the percentage of successful predictions (pocket r.m.s.d. <\u20092\u2009\u00c5). We apply quality filters to the bonded ligands and glycosylation dataset (as does PoseBusters): we include only ligands with high-quality experimental data (ranking\\_model\\_fit\u2009>\u20090.5, according to the RCSB structure validation report, that is, X-ray structures with a model quality above the median). As with the PoseBusters set, the bonded ligands and glycosylation datasets are not filtered by homology to the training dataset. Filtering on the basis of the bound polymer chain homology (using polymer template similarity\u2009<\u200940) yielded only five clusters for bonded ligands and seven clusters for glycosylation. We exclude multi-residue glycans here because the RCSB validation report does not provide a ranking\\_model\\_fit value for them. The percentage of successful predictions (pocket r.m.s.d.\u2009<\u20092\u2009\u00c5) for multi-residue glycans on all-quality experimental data is 42.1% (*n*\u2009=\u2009131 clusters), which is slightly lower than the success rate for single-residue glycans on all-quality experimental data of 46.1% (*n*\u2009=\u2009167). The modified residues dataset is filtered similarly to our other polymer test sets: it contains only modified residues in polymer chains with low homology to the training set ([Methods](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Sec7)). See Extended Data Table [1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Tab1) for detailed results, and Extended Data Fig. [6](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig11) for examples of predicted protein, DNA and RNA structures with covalent modifications, including analysis of the impact of phosphorylation on predictions.\n\nWhile expanding in modelling abilities, AF3 has also improved in protein complex accuracy relative to AlphaFold-Multimer (v.2.3)[7](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR7 \"Evans, R. et al. Protein complex prediction with AlphaFold-Multimer. Preprint at bioRxiv \n                  https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.04.463034\n                  \n                 (2022).\"),[8](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR8 \"\u017didek, A.

Generally, protein\u2013protein prediction success (DockQ\u2009>\u20090.23)[40](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR40 \"Basu, S. & Wallner, B. DockQ: a quality measure for protein-protein docking models. PLoS ONE 11, e0161879 (2016).\") has increased (paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test, *P*\u2009=\u20091.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221218), with antibody\u2013protein interaction prediction in particular showing a marked improvement (Fig. [1c](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig1) (right); paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test, *P*\u2009=\u20096.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22125, predictions top-ranked from 1,000 rather than the typical 5 seeds; further details are provided in Fig. [5a](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig5)). Protein monomer LDDT improvement is also significant (paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test, *P*\u2009=\u20091.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221234). AF3 has a very similar dependence on MSA depth to AlphaFold-Multimer v.2.3; proteins with shallow MSAs are predicted with lower accuracy (a comparison of the dependence of single-chain LDDT on MSA depth is shown in Extended Data Fig. [7a](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig12)).\n\n## Predicted confidences track accuracy\n\nAs with AF2, AF3 confidence measures are well calibrated with accuracy. Our confidence analysis is performed on the recent PDB evaluation set, with no homology filtering and including peptides. The ligands category is filtered to high-quality experimental structures as described above, and considers standard non-bonded ligands only. See Extended Data Fig. [8](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig13) for a similar assessment on bonded ligand and other interfaces. All statistics are cluster-weighted ([Methods](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Sec7)) and consider the top-ranked prediction only (ranking details are provided in Supplementary Methods\u00a0[5.9.3](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)).\n\nIn Fig. [4a](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig4) (top row), we plot the chain pair interface-predicted TM (ipTM) score[41](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR41 \"Zhang, Y. & Skolnick, J. Scoring function for automated assessment of protein structure template quality. Proteins 57, 702\u2013710 (2004).\") (Supplementary Methods\u00a0[5.9.1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)) against interface accuracy measures: protein\u2013protein DockQ, protein\u2013nucleic interface LDDT (iLDDT) and protein\u2013ligand success, with success defined as the percentage of examples under thresholded pocket-aligned r.m.s.d. values. In Fig. [4a](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig4) (bottom row), we plot the average pLDDT per protein, nucleotide or ligand entity against our bespoke LDDT\\_to\\_polymer metric (metrics details are provided in the\u00a0[Methods](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Sec7)), which is closely related to the training target of the pLDDT predictor.\n\nIn Fig. [4b\u2013e](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig4), we highlight a single example prediction of [7T82](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb7T82/pdb), in which per-atom pLDDT colouring identifies unconfident chain tails, somewhat confident interfaces and otherwise confident secondary structure. In Fig. [4c](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig4), the same prediction is coloured by chain, along with DockQ interface scores in Fig. [4d](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig4) and per-chain colouring displayed on the axes for reference. We see from Fig. [4e](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig4) that PAE confidence is high for pink\u2013grey and blue\u2013orange residue pairs for which DockQ\u2009>\u20090.7, and least confident about pink\u2013orange and pink\u2013blue residue pairs that have DockQ\u2009\u2248\u20090. A similar PAE analysis of an example with protein and nucleic acid chains is shown in Extended Data Fig. [5c,d](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig10).\n\n## Model limitations\n\nWe note model limitations of AF3 with respect to stereochemistry, hallucinations, dynamics and accuracy for certain targets.\n\nOn stereochemistry, we note two main classes of violations. The first is that the model outputs do not always respect chirality (Fig. [5b](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig5)), despite the model receiving reference structures with correct chirality as input features. To address this in the PoseBusters benchmark, we included a penalty for chirality violation in our ranking formula for model predictions. Despite this, we still observe a chirality violation rate of 4.4% in the benchmark. The second class of stereochemical violations is a tendency of the model to occasionally produce overlapping (clashing) atoms in the predictions. This sometimes manifests as extreme violations in homomers in which entire chains have been observed to overlap (Fig. [5e](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig5)). Penalizing clashes during ranking (Supplementary Methods\u00a0[5.9.3](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)) reduces the occurrence of this failure mode but does not eliminate them. Almost all remaining clashes occur for protein\u2013nucleic complexes with both greater than 100 nucleotides and greater than 2,000 residues in total.\n\nWe note that the switch from the non-generative AF2 model to the diffusion-based AF3 model introduces the challenge of spurious structural order (hallucinations) in disordered regions (Fig. [5d](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig5) and Extended Data Fig. [1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig6)). Although hallucinated regions are typically marked as very low confidence, they can lack the distinctive ribbon-like appearance that AF2 produces in disordered regions. To encourage ribbon-like predictions in AF3, we use distillation training from AF2 predictions, and we add a ranking term to encourage results with more solvent accessible surface area[36](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR36 \"Del Conte, A. et al. Critical assessment of protein intrinsic disorder prediction (CAID)\u2014results of round 2. Proteins 91, 1925\u20131934 (2023).\").\n\nA key limitation of protein structure prediction models is that they typically predict static structures as seen in the PDB, not the dynamical behaviour of biomolecular systems in solution. This limitation persists for AF3, in which multiple random seeds for either the diffusion head or the overall network do not produce an approximation of the solution ensemble.\n\nIn some cases, the modelled conformational state may not be correct or comprehensive given the specified ligands and other inputs. For example, E3 ubiquitin ligases natively adopt an open conformation in an apo state and have been observed only in a closed state when bound to ligands, but AF3 exclusively predicts the closed state for both holo and apo systems[42](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR42 \"Watson, E. R. et al. Molecular glue CELMoD compounds are regulators of cereblon conformation. Science 378, 549\u2013553 (2022).\") (Fig. [5c](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig5)). Many methods have been developed, particularly around MSA resampling, that assist in generating diversity from previous AlphaFold models[43](#ref-CR43 \"Wayment-Steele, H. K. et al. Predicting multiple conformations via sequence clustering and AlphaFold2. Nature 625, 832\u2013839 (2024).\"),[44](#ref-CR44 \"del Alamo, D., Sala, D., Mchaourab, H. S. & Meiler, J. Sampling alternative conformational states of transporters and receptors with AlphaFold2. eLife \n                  https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.75751\n                  \n                 (2022).\"),[45](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR45 \"Heo, L. & Feig, M. Multi-state modeling of G-protein coupled receptors at experimental accuracy. Proteins 90, 1873\u20131885 (2022).\") and may also assist in multistate prediction with AF3.\n\nDespite the large advance in modelling accuracy in AF3, there are still many targets for which accurate modelling can be challenging. To obtain the highest accuracy, it may be necessary to generate a large number of predictions and rank them, which incurs an extra computational cost. A class of targets in which we observe this effect strongly is antibody\u2013antigen complexes, similar to other recent work[46](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR46 \"Wallner, B. AFsample: improving multimer prediction with AlphaFold using massive sampling. Bioinformatics 39, btad573 (2023).\"). Figure [5a](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig5) shows that, for AF3, top-ranked predictions keep improving with more model seeds, even at as many as 1,000 (Wilcoxon signed-rank test between 5 and 1,000 seeds, *P*\u2009=\u20092.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22125 for percentage correct and *P*\u2009=\u20090.009 for percentage very high accuracy; ranking by protein\u2013protein interface ipTM). This large improvement with many seeds is not observed in general for other classes of molecules (Extended Data Fig. [7b](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig12)). Using only one diffusion sample per model seed for the AF3 predictions rather than five (not illustrated) does not change the results significantly, indicating that running more model seeds is necessary for antibody score improvements, rather than just more diffusion samples.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe core challenge of molecular biology is to understand and ultimately regulate the complex atomic interactions of biological systems. The AF3 model takes a large step in this direction, demonstrating that it is possible to accurately predict the structure of a wide range of biomolecular systems in a unified framework. Although there are still substantial challenges to achieve highly accurate predictions across all interaction types, we demonstrate that it is possible to build a deep-learning system that shows strong coverage and generalization for all of these interactions. We also demonstrate that the lack of cross-entity evolutionary information is not a substantial blocker to progress in predicting these interactions and, moreover, substantial improvement in antibody results suggests AlphaFold-derived methods are able to model the chemistry and physics of classes of molecular interactions without dependence on MSAs. Finally, the large improvement in protein\u2013ligand structure prediction shows that it is possible to handle the wide diversity of chemical space within a general deep-learning framework and without resorting to an artificial separation between protein structure prediction and ligand docking.\n\nThe development of bottom-up modelling of cellular components is a key step in unravelling the complexity of molecular regulation within the cell, and the performance of AF3 shows that developing the right deep-learning frameworks can massively reduce the amount of data required to obtain biologically relevant performance on these tasks and amplify the impact of the data already collected. We expect that structural modelling will continue to improve not only due to advances in deep learning but also because continuing methodological advances in experimental structure determination, such as the substantial improvements in cryo-electron microscopy and tomography, will provide a wealth of new training data to further the improve the generalization ability of such models. The parallel developments of experimental and computational methods promise to propel us further into an era of structurally informed biological understanding and therapeutic development.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Full algorithm details\n\nExtensive explanations of the components are available in Supplementary Methods\u00a0[2](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)\u2013[5](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1). Moreover, pseudocode is available in Supplementary Algorithms\u00a0[1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)\u2013[31](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1), network diagrams in Figs. [1d](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig1) and \u00a0[2a\u2013c](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig2) and Supplementary Fig. [2](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1), input features in Supplementary Table [5](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1) and additional hyperparameters for training in Supplementary Tables [3](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1), [4](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1) and [7](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1).\n\n### Training regime\n\nNo structural data used during training were released after 30 September 2021 and, for the model used in PoseBusters evaluations, we filtered out PDB[32](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR32 \"Berman, H. M. et al. The Protein Data Bank. Nucleic Acids Res. 28, 235\u2013242 (2000).\") structures released after 30 September 2021. One optimizer step uses a mini batch of 256 input data samples and during initial training 256\u2009\u00d7\u200948\u2009=\u200912,288 diffusion samples. For fine-tuning, the number of diffusion samples is reduced to 256\u2009\u00d7\u200932 = 8,192. The model is trained in three stages\u2014the initial training with a crop size of 384 tokens and two sequential fine tuning stages with crop sizes of\u00a0640 and 768 tokens. Further details are provided in Supplementary Methods\u00a0[5.2](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1).\n\n### Inference regime\n\nNo inference time templates or reference ligand position features were released after 30 September 2021, and in the case of PoseBusters evaluation, an earlier cut-off date of 30 September 2019 was used. The model can be run with different random seeds to generate alternative results, with a batch of diffusion samples per seed. Unless otherwise stated, all results are generated by selecting the top confidence sample from running 5 seeds of the same trained model, with 5 diffusion samples per model seed, for a total of 25 samples to choose from. Standard crystallization aids are excluded from predictions (Supplementary Table [8](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)).\n\nResults are shown for the top-ranked sample and sample ranking depends on whether trying to select the overall best output globally, or the best output for some chain, interface or modified residue. Global ranking uses a mix of pTM and ipTM along with terms to reduce cases with large numbers of clashes and increase rates of disorder; individual chain ranking uses a chain specific pTM measure; interface ranking uses a bespoke ipTM measure for the relevant chain pair; and modified residue ranking uses average pLDDT over the residue of interest (Supplementary Methods\u00a0[5.9.3](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)).\n\n### Metrics\n\nEvaluation compares a predicted structure to the corresponding ground-truth structure. If the complex contains multiple identical entities, assignment of the predicted units to the ground-truth units is found by maximizing LDDT. Assignment in local symmetry groups of atoms in ligands is solved by exhaustive search over the first 1,000 per-residue symmetries as given by RDKit.\n\nWe measure the quality of the predictions with DockQ, LDDT or pocket-aligned r.m.s.d. For nucleic\u2013protein interfaces, we measure interface accuracy through iLDDT, which is calculated from distances between atoms across different chains in the interface. DockQ and iLDDT are highly correlated (Extended Data Fig. [9](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig14)), so the standard cut-offs for DockQ can be translated to equivalent iLDDT cut-offs. Nucleic acid LDDTs (intrachains and interface) were calculated with an inclusion radius of 30\u2009\u00c5 compared with the usual 15\u2009\u00c5 used for proteins, owing to their larger scale. For confidence calibration assessment, we use a bespoke LDDT (LDDT\\_to\\_polymer) metric that considers differences from each atom of a given entity to any C\u03b1 or C1\u2032 polymer atom within its inclusion radius. This is closely related to how the confidence prediction is trained (Supplementary Methods\u00a0[4.3.1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)).\n\nPocket-aligned r.m.s.d. is computed as follows: the pocket is defined as all heavy atoms within 10\u2009\u00c5 of any heavy atom of the ligand, restricted to the primary polymer chain for the ligand or modified residue being scored, and further restricted to only backbone atoms for proteins. The primary polymer chain is defined variously: for PoseBusters, it is the protein chain with the most atoms within 10\u2009\u00c5 of the ligand; for bonded ligand scores, it is the bonded polymer chain; and for modified residues, it is the chain in which the residue is contained (minus that residue). The pocket is used to align the predicted structure to the ground-truth structure with least-squares rigid alignment and then the r.m.s.d. is computed on all heavy atoms of the ligand.\n\n### Recent PDB evaluation set\n\nGeneral model evaluation was performed on our recent PDB set consisting of 8,856 PDB complexes released between 1 May 2022 and 12 January 2023. The set contains almost all PDB complexes released during that period that are less than 5,120 model tokens in size (Supplementary Methods\u00a0[6.1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)). Single chains and interfaces within each structure were scored separately rather than only looking at full complex scores, and clustering was then applied to chains and interfaces so that scores could be aggregated first within clusters and then across clusters for mean scores, or using a weighting of inverse cluster size for distributional statistics (Supplementary Methods\u00a0[6.2](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1) and [6.4](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)).\n\nEvaluation on ligands excludes standard crystallization aids (Supplementary Table [8](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)), our ligand exclusion list (Supplementary Table [9](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)) and glycans (Supplementary Table [10](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)). Bonded and non-bonded ligands are evaluated separately. Ions are only included when specifically mentioned (Supplementary Table [11](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)).\n\nThe recent PDB set is filtered to a low homology subset (Supplementary Methods\u00a0[6.1](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)) for some results where stated. Homology is defined as sequence identity to sequences in the training set and is measured by template search (Supplementary Methods\u00a0[2.4](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)). Individual polymer chains in evaluation complexes are filtered out if the maximum sequence identity to chains in the training set is greater than 40%, where sequence identity is the percentage of residues in the evaluation set chain that are identical to the training set chain. Individual peptide chains (protein chains with less than 16 residues) are always filtered out. For polymer\u2013polymer interfaces, if both polymers have greater than 40% sequence identity to two chains in the same complex in the training set, then the interface is filtered out. For interfaces to a peptide, the interface is filtered out if the non-peptide entity has greater than 40% sequence identity to any chain in the training set.\n\nTo compare the quality of prediction of protein\u2013protein interfaces and protein monomers against that of AlphaFold-Multimer\u00a0(v.2.3)[8](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR8 \"\u017didek, A. AlphaFold v.2.3.0 Technical Note. GitHub \n                  https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold/blob/main/docs/technical_note_v2.3.0.md\n                  \n                 (2022).\"), and to compare the dependence of single-protein-chain prediction quality on MSA depth, we restrict the low-homology recent PDB set to complexes with fewer than 20 protein chains and fewer than 2,560 tokens. We compare against unrelaxed AlphaFold-Multimer v.2.3 predictions.\n\nTo study antibody-antigen interface prediction, we filter the low homology recent PDB set to complexes that contain at least one protein\u2013protein interface where one of the protein chains is in one of the two largest PDB chain clusters (these clusters are representative of antibodies). We further filter to complexes with at most 2,560 tokens and with no unknown amino acids in the PDB to allow extensive comparison against relaxed predictions of AlphaFold-Multimer v2.3. That leaves 71 antibody\u2013antigen complexes, containing 166 antibody\u2013antigen interfaces spanning 65 interface clusters.\n\nMSA depth analysis (Extended Data Fig. [7a](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig12)) was based on computing the normalized number of effective sequences (*N*eff) for each position of a query sequence. Per-residue *N*eff values were obtained by counting the number of non-gap residues in the MSA for this position and weighting the sequences using the *N*eff scheme[49](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR49 \"Wu, T., Hou, J., Adhikari, B. & Cheng, J. Analysis of several key factors influencing deep learning-based inter-residue contact prediction. Bioinformatics 36, 1091\u20131098 (2020).\") with a threshold of 80% sequence identity measured on the region that is non-gap in either sequence.\n\n### Nucleic acid prediction baseline\n\nFor benchmarking performance on nucleic acid structure prediction, we report baseline comparisons to an existing machine learning system for protein\u2013nucleic acid and RNA tertiary structure prediction, RoseTTAFold2NA[18](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR18 \"Baek, M. et al. Accurate prediction of protein\u2013nucleic acid complexes using RoseTTAFoldNA. Nat. Methods 21, 117\u2013121 (2024).\"). We run the open source RF2NA[50](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR50 \"DiMaio, F. RF2NA v.0.2. GitHub \n                  https://github.com/uw-ipd/RoseTTAFold2NA/releases/tag/v0.2\n                  \n                 (2023).\") with the same MSAs as those that were used for AF3 predictions. For comparison between AF3 and RF2NA, a subset of our recent PDB set was chosen to meet the RF2NA criteria (<1,000 total residues and nucleotides). As RF2NA was not trained to predict systems with DNA and RNA, analysis is limited to targets with only one nucleic acid type. No system was publicly available at time of writing for baseline comparisons on data with arbitrary combinations of biomolecular types in PDB.\n\nAs an additional baseline for RNA tertiary structure prediction, we evaluate AF3 performance on CASP15 RNA targets that were publicly available\u00a0as of 1 December 2023 (R1116/8S95, R1117/8FZA, R1126 (downloaded from the CASP15 website <https://predictioncenter.org/casp15/TARGETS_PDB/R1126.pdb>), R1128/8BTZ, R1136/7ZJ4, R1138/[7PTK/7PTL], R1189/7YR7 and R1190/7YR6). We compare the top-1 ranked predictions and, where multiple ground-truth structures exist (R1136), the prediction is scored against the closest state. We display comparisons to RF2NA as a representative machine learning system; AIchemy\\_RNA2 as the top performing entrant with human intervention; and AIchemy\\_RNA as the top performing machine learning system. All entrants\u2019 predictions were downloaded from the CASP website and scored internally.\n\n### PoseBusters\n\nWhile other analyses used an AlphaFold model trained on PDB data released before a cut-off of 30 September 2021, our PoseBusters analysis was conducted on a model (with identical architecture and similar training schedule) differing only in the use of an earlier 30 September 2019 cut-off. This analysis therefore did not include training data, inference time templates or \u2018ref\\_pos\u2019 features released after this date.\n\nInference was performed on the asymmetric unit from specified PDBs, with the following minor modifications. In several PDB files, chains clashing with the ligand of interest were removed ([7O1T](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb7O1T/pdb), [7PUV](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb7PUV/pdb), [7SCW](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb7SCW/pdb), [7WJB](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb7WJB/pdb), [7ZXV](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb7ZXV/pdb), [8AIE](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb8AIE/pdb)). Another PDB entry ([8F4J](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb8F4J/pdb)) was too large to inference the entire system (over 5,120 tokens), so we included only protein chains within 20\u2009\u00c5 of the ligand of interest. Five model seeds, each with five diffusion samples, were produced per target, resulting in 25 predictions, which were ranked by quality and predicted accuracy: the ranking score was calculated from an ipTM aggregate (Supplementary Methods\u00a0[5.9.3](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1) (point 3)), then further divided by 100 if the ligand had chirality errors or had clashes with the protein.\n\nFor pocket-aligned r.m.s.d., first alignment between the predicted and ground-truth structures was conducted by aligning to the ground-truth pocket backbone atoms (CA, C or N atoms within 10\u2009\u00c5 of the ligand of interest) from the primary protein chain (the chain with the greatest number of contacts within 10\u2009\u00c5 of the ligand). The PoseBusters Python package v.0.2.7[51](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR51 \"Buttenschoen, M. PoseBusters v.0.2.7. GitHub \n                  https://github.com/maabuu/posebusters/releases/tag/v0.2.7\n                  \n                 (2023).\") was used to score r.m.s.d. and violations from the pocket-aligned predictions.\n\nWhile AlphaFold models are \u2018blind\u2019 to the protein pocket, docking is often performed with knowledge of the protein pocket residues. For example, Uni-Mol specifies the pocket as any residue within 6\u2009\u00c5 of the heavy atoms in the ligand of interest[26](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#ref-CR26 \"Zhou, G. et al. Uni-Mol: a universal 3D molecular representation learning framework. Preprint at ChemRxiv \n                  https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/6402990d37e01856dc1d1581\n                  \n                 (2023).\"). To evaluate the ability of AF3 to dock ligands accurately when given pocket information, we fine-tuned a 30 September 2019 cut-off AF3 model with an additional token feature specifying pocket\u2013ligand pairs (Supplementary Methods\u00a0[2.8](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#MOESM1)). Specifically, an additional token feature was introduced, set to true for a ligand entity of interest and any pocket residues with heavy atoms within 6\u2009\u00c5 of the ligand entity. At training time, a single random ligand entity is chosen to use in this feature. Note that multiple ligand chains with the same entity (CCD code) may be selected. At inference time, the ligand entity was chosen based on the ligand of interest\u2019s CCD code, so again multiple ligand chains were occasionally chosen. The results of this analysis are shown in Extended Data Fig. [4](/articles/s41586-024-07487-w#Fig9).\n\n### Model performance analysis and visualization\n\nData analysis used Python v.3.11.7 (<https://www.python.org/>), NumPy v.1.26.3 (<https://github.com/numpy/numpy>), SciPy v.1.9.3 (<https://www.scipy.org/>), seaborn v.0.12.2 (<https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn>), Matplotlib v.3.6.1 (<https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib>), pandas v.2.0.3 (<https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas>), statsmodels v.0.12.2 (<https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels>), RDKit v.4.3.0 (<https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit>) and Colab (<https://research.google.com/colaboratory>).
