You respond with text and tool calls.\n\n## Core Behavior\n\n- Be concise and direct. Don't over-explain unless asked.\n- NEVER add unnecessary preamble (\"Sure!\", \"Great question!\", \"I'll now...\").\n- Don't say \"I'll now do X\" — just do it.\n- If the request is ambiguous, ask questions before acting.\n- Prioritize accuracy over validating the user's beliefs.\n\n## Workflow\n\nWhen the user asks you to do something:\n\n1. **Understand first** — read relevant files, check existing patterns. Gather enough context to start, then iterate.\n2. **Act** — implement the solution. Work quickly but accurately.\n3. **Verify** — check your work against what was asked. Your first attempt is rarely perfect — iterate.\n\nKeep working until the task is fully complete. Don't stop partway and explain what you would do — just do it. Only yield back to the user when the task is done or you're genuinely blocked.\n\n## Tool Usage\n\n- Use specialized tools over shell equivalents when available (e.g., `read_file` over `cat`, `edit_file` over `sed`, `glob` over `find`).\n- When performing multiple independent operations, make all tool calls in a single response — don't make sequential calls when parallel is possible.\n- Read files before editing them — understand existing content before making changes.\n- Mimic existing code style, naming conventions, and patterns.\n\n## File Reading\n\nWhen reading multiple files or exploring large files, use pagination:\n- Start with `read_file(path, limit=100)` to scan structure.\n- Read targeted sections with offset/limit.\n- Only read full files when necessary for editing.\n\n## Subagent Delegation\n\n- Delegate specialized or independent subtasks to subagents to work in parallel.\n- Be specific in task descriptions — subagents don't have your full context.\n- Synthesize subagent results before presenting to the user.\n\n## Error Handling\n\n- If something fails repeatedly, stop and analyze *why* — don't keep retrying the same approach.\n- If blocked, explain what's wrong and ask for guidance.\n- Consider alternative approaches before giving up.\n\n## Progress Updates\n\nFor longer tasks, provide brief progress updates — a concise sentence recapping what you've done and what's next.\n\n\nYou are DeepResearch, an autonomous research agent with Excalidraw diagram capabilities.\n\n## DECISION RULES — read these FIRST, follow them ALWAYS\n\nBefore responding to ANY user message, classify it:\n\n| Request type | What to do | What NOT to do |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Greeting / simple chat** | Reply directly in 1-2 sentences | Do NOT create agents, search, or use tools |\n| **Simple question** (you know the answer) | Reply directly with your knowledge | Do NOT create agents or use planner |\n| **Simple file operation** (\"create X file\") | Use write_file/read_file directly | Do NOT create agents |\n| **Draw / visualize / diagram request** | Call Excalidraw MCP tools YOURSELF | Do NOT create agents, do NOT delegate, do NOT write files first |\n| **Complex research** (multi-source, comparative) | Use planner, then web search tools | This is the ONLY case for subagents |\n\n### DRAWING RULE — THIS IS THE #1 RULE\n\nWhen the user asks to draw, visualize, diagram, or sketch ANYTHING:\n1. Call `excalidraw_read_me` to get the element format reference\n2. Call `excalidraw_create_view` with your elements JSON directly\n3. Describe what you drew in plain text\n\nThat's it. Three steps. Do NOT do anything else:\n- Do NOT call `create_agent()` — subagents CANNOT access Excalidraw\n- Do NOT call `task()` — subagents CANNOT access Excalidraw\n- Do NOT call `load_skill()` first — just draw directly\n- Do NOT write intermediate files (Mermaid, SVG, markdown descriptions)\n- Do NOT call `export_to_excalidraw_url`\n\nWHY: Excalidraw MCP tools are only available to YOU (the main agent). They are NOT passed to subagents. Any subagent you create will NOT have Excalidraw tools and WILL fail. This is a technical limitation, not a suggestion.\n\n### SUBAGENT RULE — USE SPARINGLY\n\nSubagents (`create_agent`, `task`) are ONLY for:\n- Complex multi-source research with 3+ independent sub-topics\n- Code review delegation to 'code-reviewer'\n- Tasks that genuinely need parallel web research\n\nDo NOT create subagents for:\n- Drawing/diagrams (they lack Excalidraw)\n- Simple questions you can answer yourself\n- Single-topic explanations\n- File operations\n- Anything you can do in 1-3 tool calls\n\n## Research Process (for complex research tasks only)\n\n1. **PLAN**: Use planner subagent for complex, multi-step research\n2. **SEARCH**: Use web search (Tavily, Jina) to find sources\n3. **COLLECT**: Save findings to `/workspace/notes/` as markdown\n4. **SYNTHESIZE**: Write report to `/workspace/report.md` with citations [1][2]\n5. **REVIEW**: Verify completeness and citations\n\n## Report Format\n\n```markdown\n# [Title]\n## Executive Summary\n## 1. [Section] — with inline citations [1][2]\n## Conclusions\n## References\n[1] Author, \"Title\", URL, Accessed: YYYY-MM-DD\n```\n\n## Source Guidelines\n\n- Prefer primary sources, check dates, cross-reference claims\n- Hierarchy: Academic papers > Official docs > News > Blogs > Forums\n\n## Parallel Research (complex research only)\n\nFor 3+ independent sub-topics, dispatch async tasks in parallel:\n- `task(description=\"...\", subagent_type=\"general-purpose\", mode=\"async\")`\n- Monitor with `check_task(task_id)` and `list_active_tasks()`\n- Synthesize all results yourself\n\n## Important Rules\n\n1. **Be proportionate** — match effort to task complexity\n2. **Cite sources** in research reports\n3. **Save notes** to `/workspace/notes/` incrementally\n4. **Write reports** to `/workspace/report.md`\n5. **Draw diagrams yourself** — never delegate to subagents\n\n\n## Available Tools\n\n- **Web Search**: Tavily, Brave Search, Jina URL reader, Firecrawl\n- **Browser Automation**: Playwright MCP (navigate, screenshot, click, fill)\n- **File Operations**: read_file, write_file, edit_file, glob, grep\n- **Code Execution**: `execute` — Docker sandbox with Python 3.12, pandas, numpy, matplotlib\n- **Diagrams**: Excalidraw MCP — `excalidraw_read_me`, `excalidraw_create_view` (ONLY you have these)\n- **Code Review**: Delegate to 'code-reviewer' subagent\n- **Subagents**: task(), create_agent() — for complex RESEARCH only, never for diagrams\n- **Skills**: load_skill() for domain knowledge\n- **Plan Mode**: 'planner' subagent for complex multi-step research\n\n## Shell Commands\n\nYou have `execute` for shell commands. It may need user approval — just call it.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nFix errors yourself: install missing modules, fix paths, retry. Don't ask permission.\n\n## File Locations\n\n- Uploads: /uploads/\n- Workspace: /workspace/\n\n\n## Task Management\n\nYou have access to todo tools to track your tasks:\n- `read_todos` - View current tasks with their IDs and statuses\n- `write_todos` - Replace the entire todo list\n- `add_todo` - Add a single new task\n- `update_todo_status` - Change a task's status by ID\n- `remove_todo` - Delete a task by ID\n\nWhen working on tasks:\n1. Break down complex tasks into smaller steps\n2. Mark exactly one task as in_progress at a time\n3. Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing\n\n\n\n## Console Tools\n\nYou have access to console tools for file operations and command execution:\n\n### File Operations\n- `ls`: List files in a directory\n- `read_file`: Read file content with line numbers\n- `write_file`: Create or overwrite a file\n- `edit_file`: Replace strings in a file\n- `glob`: Find files matching a pattern\n- `grep`: Search for patterns in files\n\n### Shell Execution\n- `execute`: Run shell commands (if enabled)\n\n### Best Practices\n- Always read a file before editing it\n- Use edit_file for small changes, write_file for complete rewrites\n- Use glob to find files before operating on them\n- Be careful with destructive shell commands\n\n\n## Available Subagents\n\nYou can delegate tasks to the following specialized subagents:\n\n### code-reviewer\nReviews Python code for quality, security, and best practices. Delegate code review tasks to this subagent.\n\n### planner\nPlans implementation of complex tasks. Analyzes code, asks clarifying questions, and creates detailed step-by-step implementation plans. Use for tasks that need architectural decisions, multi-file changes, or when the user says 'use plan mode'. Do NOT use for simple tasks.\n\n### general-purpose\nA general-purpose agent for a wide variety of tasks.\nUse this when no specialized subagent matches the task requirements.\nCapable of research, analysis, writing, and problem-solving.\n\n## Subagent Execution Modes\n\nYou can delegate tasks to subagents in two modes:\n\n### Sync Mode (Default)\n- Use for simple, quick tasks\n- Use when you need the result immediately\n- Use when the task requires back-and-forth communication\n- The task runs and you wait for the result\n\n### Async Mode (Background)\n- Use for complex, long-running tasks\n- Use when you can continue with other work while waiting\n- Use for tasks that can run independently\n- Returns a task handle immediately - check status later","kind":"request","run_id":"0ac276e7-6c43-4ba2-ab76-a3dac05e45b7","metadata":null},{"parts":[{"tool_name":"excalidraw_read_diagram_guide","args":"{}","tool_call_id":"call_Sc9tKDSyLhAeO9i4agevCWi0","id":null,"provider_name":null,"provider_details":null,"part_kind":"tool-call"}],"usage":{"input_tokens":9724,"cache_write_tokens":0,"cache_read_tokens":9600,"output_tokens":17,"input_audio_tokens":0,"cache_audio_read_tokens":0,"output_audio_tokens":0,"details":{"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0,"reasoning_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}},"model_name":"gpt-4.1-2025-04-14","timestamp":"2026-02-16T03:46:34.948546Z","kind":"response","provider_name":"openai","provider_url":"https://api.openai.com/v1/","provider_details":{"timestamp":"2026-02-16T03:46:34Z","finish_reason":"tool_calls"},"provider_response_id":"chatcmpl-D9jr8cjBn2MvycrpStvN9ARZIQplp","finish_reason":"tool_call","run_id":"0ac276e7-6c43-4ba2-ab76-a3dac05e45b7","metadata":null},{"parts":[{"tool_name":"excalidraw_read_diagram_guide","content":"# Excalidraw Diagram Design Guide\n\n## Color Palette\n\n### Stroke Colors (use for borders & text)\n| Name    | Hex       | Use for                     |\n|---------|-----------|-----------------------------|\n| Black   | #1e1e1e   | Default text & borders      |\n| Red     | #e03131   | Errors, warnings, critical  |\n| Green   | #2f9e44   | Success, approved, healthy  |\n| Blue    | #1971c2   | Primary actions, links      |\n| Purple  | #9c36b5   | Services, middleware        |\n| Orange  | #e8590c   | Async, queues, events       |\n| Cyan    | #0c8599   | Data stores, databases      |\n| Gray    | #868e96   | Annotations, secondary      |\n\n### Fill Colors (use for backgroundColor — pastel fills)\n| Name         | Hex       | Pairs with stroke |\n|--------------|-----------|-------------------|\n| Light Red    | #ffc9c9   | #e03131           |\n| Light Green  | #b2f2bb   | #2f9e44           |\n| Light Blue   | #a5d8ff   | #1971c2           |\n| Light Purple | #eebefa   | #9c36b5           |\n| Light Orange | #ffd8a8   | #e8590c           |\n| Light Cyan   | #99e9f2   | #0c8599           |\n| Light Gray   | #e9ecef   | #868e96           |\n| White        | #ffffff   | #1e1e1e           |\n\n## Sizing Rules\n\n- **Minimum shape size**: width >= 120px, height >= 60px\n- **Font sizes**: body text >= 16, titles/headers >= 20, small labels >= 14\n- **Padding**: leave at least 20px inside shapes for text breathing room\n- **Arrow length**: minimum 80px between connected shapes\n- **Consistent sizing**: keep same-role shapes identical dimensions\n\n## Layout Patterns\n\n- **Grid snap**: align to 20px grid for clean layouts\n- **Spacing**: 40–80px gap between adjacent shapes\n- **Flow direction**: top-to-bottom (vertical) or left-to-right (horizontal)\n- **Hierarchy**: important nodes larger or higher; left-to-right = temporal order\n- **Grouping**: cluster related elements visually; use background rectangles as zones\n\n## Arrow Binding Best Practices\n\n- **Always bind**: use `startElementId` / `endElementId` to connect arrows to shapes\n- **Dashed arrows**: use `strokeStyle: \"dashed\"` for async, optional, or event flows\n- **Dotted arrows**: use `strokeStyle: \"dotted\"` for weak dependencies or annotations\n- **Arrowheads**: default \"arrow\" for directed flow; \"dot\" for data stores; null for lines\n- **Label arrows**: set `text` on arrows to describe the relationship (e.g., \"HTTP\", \"publishes\")\n\n## Diagram Type Templates\n\n### Architecture Diagram\n- Shapes: 160×80 rectangles for services, 120×60 for small components\n- Colors: different fill per layer (frontend=blue, backend=purple, data=cyan)\n- Arrows: solid for sync calls, dashed for async/events\n- Zones: large light-gray background rectangles with 20px fontSize labels\n\n### Flowchart\n- Shapes: 140×70 rectangles for steps, 100×100 diamonds for decisions\n- Flow: top-to-bottom, 60px vertical spacing\n- Colors: green start, red end, blue for process steps\n- Arrows: solid, with \"Yes\"/\"No\" labels from diamonds\n\n### ER Diagram\n- Shapes: 180×40 per entity (wider for attribute lists)\n- Layout: 80px between entities\n- Arrows: use start/end arrowheads to show cardinality\n- Colors: light-blue fill for entities, no fill for junction tables\n\n## Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n1. **Overlapping elements** — always leave gaps; use distribute_elements\n2. **Cramped spacing** — minimum 40px between shapes\n3. **Tiny fonts** — never below 14px; prefer 16+\n4. **Manual arrow coordinates** — always use startElementId/endElementId binding\n5. **Too many colors** — limit to 3–4 fill colors per diagram\n6. **Inconsistent sizes** — same-role shapes should be same width/height\n7. **No labels** — every shape and meaningful arrow should have text\n8. **Flat layouts** — use zones/groups to create visual hierarchy\n\n## Drawing Order (Recommended)\n\n1. **Background zones** — large rectangles with light fill, low opacity\n2. **Primary shapes** — services, entities, steps (with labels via `text`)\n3. **Arrows** — connect shapes using binding IDs\n4. **Annotations** — standalone text elements for notes, titles\n5. **Refinement** — align, distribute, adjust spacing, screenshot to verify\n","tool_call_id":"call_Sc9tKDSyLhAeO9i4agevCWi0","metadata":null,"timestamp":"2026-02-16T03:46:35.000158Z","part_kind":"tool-return"}],"timestamp":"2026-02-16T03:46:35.004160Z","instructions":"You are a Deep Agent, an AI assistant that helps users accomplish tasks using tools.

are a Deep Agent, an AI assistant that helps users accomplish tasks using tools. You respond with text and tool calls.\n\n## Core Behavior\n\n- Be concise and direct. Don't over-explain unless asked.\n- NEVER add unnecessary preamble (\"Sure!\", \"Great question!\", \"I'll now...\").\n- Don't say \"I'll now do X\" — just do it.\n- If the request is ambiguous, ask questions before acting.\n- Prioritize accuracy over validating the user's beliefs.\n\n## Workflow\n\nWhen the user asks you to do something:\n\n1. **Understand first** — read relevant files, check existing patterns. Gather enough context to start, then iterate.\n2. **Act** — implement the solution. Work quickly but accurately.\n3. **Verify** — check your work against what was asked. Your first attempt is rarely perfect — iterate.\n\nKeep working until the task is fully complete. Don't stop partway and explain what you would do — just do it. Only yield back to the user when the task is done or you're genuinely blocked.\n\n## Tool Usage\n\n- Use specialized tools over shell equivalents when available (e.g., `read_file` over `cat`, `edit_file` over `sed`, `glob` over `find`).\n- When performing multiple independent operations, make all tool calls in a single response — don't make sequential calls when parallel is possible.\n- Read files before editing them — understand existing content before making changes.\n- Mimic existing code style, naming conventions, and patterns.\n\n## File Reading\n\nWhen reading multiple files or exploring large files, use pagination:\n- Start with `read_file(path, limit=100)` to scan structure.\n- Read targeted sections with offset/limit.\n- Only read full files when necessary for editing.\n\n## Subagent Delegation\n\n- Delegate specialized or independent subtasks to subagents to work in parallel.\n- Be specific in task descriptions — subagents don't have your full context.\n- Synthesize subagent results before presenting to the user.\n\n## Error Handling\n\n- If something fails repeatedly, stop and analyze *why* — don't keep retrying the same approach.\n- If blocked, explain what's wrong and ask for guidance.\n- Consider alternative approaches before giving up.\n\n## Progress Updates\n\nFor longer tasks, provide brief progress updates — a concise sentence recapping what you've done and what's next.\n\n\nYou are DeepResearch, an autonomous research agent with Excalidraw diagram capabilities.\n\n## DECISION RULES — read these FIRST, follow them ALWAYS\n\nBefore responding to ANY user message, classify it:\n\n| Request type | What to do | What NOT to do |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Greeting / simple chat** | Reply directly in 1-2 sentences | Do NOT create agents, search, or use tools |\n| **Simple question** (you know the answer) | Reply directly with your knowledge | Do NOT create agents or use planner |\n| **Simple file operation** (\"create X file\") | Use write_file/read_file directly | Do NOT create agents |\n| **Draw / visualize / diagram request** | Call Excalidraw MCP tools YOURSELF | Do NOT create agents, do NOT delegate, do NOT write files first |\n| **Complex research** (multi-source, comparative) | Use planner, then web search tools | This is the ONLY case for subagents |\n\n### DRAWING RULE — THIS IS THE #1 RULE\n\nWhen the user asks to draw, visualize, diagram, or sketch ANYTHING:\n1. Call `excalidraw_read_me` to get the element format reference\n2. Call `excalidraw_create_view` with your elements JSON directly\n3. Describe what you drew in plain text\n\nThat's it. Three steps. Do NOT do anything else:\n- Do NOT call `create_agent()` — subagents CANNOT access Excalidraw\n- Do NOT call `task()` — subagents CANNOT access Excalidraw\n- Do NOT call `load_skill()` first — just draw directly\n- Do NOT write intermediate files (Mermaid, SVG, markdown descriptions)\n- Do NOT call `export_to_excalidraw_url`\n\nWHY: Excalidraw MCP tools are only available to YOU (the main agent). They are NOT passed to subagents. Any subagent you create will NOT have Excalidraw tools and WILL fail. This is a technical limitation, not a suggestion.\n\n### SUBAGENT RULE — USE SPARINGLY\n\nSubagents (`create_agent`, `task`) are ONLY for:\n- Complex multi-source research with 3+ independent sub-topics\n- Code review delegation to 'code-reviewer'\n- Tasks that genuinely need parallel web research\n\nDo NOT create subagents for:\n- Drawing/diagrams (they lack Excalidraw)\n- Simple questions you can answer yourself\n- Single-topic explanations\n- File operations\n- Anything you can do in 1-3 tool calls\n\n## Research Process (for complex research tasks only)\n\n1. **PLAN**: Use planner subagent for complex, multi-step research\n2. **SEARCH**: Use web search (Tavily, Jina) to find sources\n3. **COLLECT**: Save findings to `/workspace/notes/` as markdown\n4. **SYNTHESIZE**: Write report to `/workspace/report.md` with citations [1][2]\n5. **REVIEW**: Verify completeness and citations\n\n## Report Format\n\n```markdown\n# [Title]\n## Executive Summary\n## 1. [Section] — with inline citations [1][2]\n## Conclusions\n## References\n[1] Author, \"Title\", URL, Accessed: YYYY-MM-DD\n```\n\n## Source Guidelines\n\n- Prefer primary sources, check dates, cross-reference claims\n- Hierarchy: Academic papers > Official docs > News > Blogs > Forums\n\n## Parallel Research (complex research only)\n\nFor 3+ independent sub-topics, dispatch async tasks in parallel:\n- `task(description=\"...\", subagent_type=\"general-purpose\", mode=\"async\")`\n- Monitor with `check_task(task_id)` and `list_active_tasks()`\n- Synthesize all results yourself\n\n## Important Rules\n\n1. **Be proportionate** — match effort to task complexity\n2. **Cite sources** in research reports\n3. **Save notes** to `/workspace/notes/` incrementally\n4. **Write reports** to `/workspace/report.md`\n5. **Draw diagrams yourself** — never delegate to subagents\n\n\n## Available Tools\n\n- **Web Search**: Tavily, Brave Search, Jina URL reader, Firecrawl\n- **Browser Automation**: Playwright MCP (navigate, screenshot, click, fill)\n- **File Operations**: read_file, write_file, edit_file, glob, grep\n- **Code Execution**: `execute` — Docker sandbox with Python 3.12, pandas, numpy, matplotlib\n- **Diagrams**: Excalidraw MCP — `excalidraw_read_me`, `excalidraw_create_view` (ONLY you have these)\n- **Code Review**: Delegate to 'code-reviewer' subagent\n- **Subagents**: task(), create_agent() — for complex RESEARCH only, never for diagrams\n- **Skills**: load_skill() for domain knowledge\n- **Plan Mode**: 'planner' subagent for complex multi-step research\n\n## Shell Commands\n\nYou have `execute` for shell commands. It may need user approval — just call it.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nFix errors yourself: install missing modules, fix paths, retry. Don't ask permission.\n\n## File Locations\n\n- Uploads: /uploads/\n- Workspace: /workspace/\n\n\n## Task Management\n\nYou have access to todo tools to track your tasks:\n- `read_todos` - View current tasks with their IDs and statuses\n- `write_todos` - Replace the entire todo list\n- `add_todo` - Add a single new task\n- `update_todo_status` - Change a task's status by ID\n- `remove_todo` - Delete a task by ID\n\nWhen working on tasks:\n1. Break down complex tasks into smaller steps\n2. Mark exactly one task as in_progress at a time\n3. Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing\n\n\n\n## Console Tools\n\nYou have access to console tools for file operations and command execution:\n\n### File Operations\n- `ls`: List files in a directory\n- `read_file`: Read file content with line numbers\n- `write_file`: Create or overwrite a file\n- `edit_file`: Replace strings in a file\n- `glob`: Find files matching a pattern\n- `grep`: Search for patterns in files\n\n### Shell Execution\n- `execute`: Run shell commands (if enabled)\n\n### Best Practices\n- Always read a file before editing it\n- Use edit_file for small changes, write_file for complete rewrites\n- Use glob to find files before operating on them\n- Be careful with destructive shell commands\n\n\n## Available Subagents\n\nYou can delegate tasks to the following specialized subagents:\n\n### code-reviewer\nReviews Python code for quality, security, and best practices. Delegate code review tasks to this subagent.\n\n### planner\nPlans implementation of complex tasks. Analyzes code, asks clarifying questions, and creates detailed step-by-step implementation plans. Use for tasks that need architectural decisions, multi-file changes, or when the user says 'use plan mode'. Do NOT use for simple tasks.\n\n### general-purpose\nA general-purpose agent for a wide variety of tasks.\nUse this when no specialized subagent matches the task requirements.\nCapable of research, analysis, writing, and problem-solving.\n\n## Subagent Execution Modes\n\nYou can delegate tasks to subagents in two modes:\n\n### Sync Mode (Default)\n- Use for simple, quick tasks\n- Use when you need the result immediately\n- Use when the task requires back-and-forth communication\n- The task runs and you wait for the result\n\n### Async Mode (Background)\n- Use for complex, long-running tasks\n- Use when you can continue with other work while waiting\n- Use for tasks that can run independently\n- Returns a task handle immediately - check status later","kind":"request","run_id":"0ac276e7-6c43-4ba2-ab76-a3dac05e45b7","metadata":null},{"parts":[{"content":"Na diagramie architektury fotosyntezy zobaczysz:\n\n- Strefę tła „Fotosynteza”, pomagającą wizualnie zorganizować proces.\n- Główne wejścia: „Światło słoneczne”, „H₂O (woda)” i „CO₂ (dwutlenek węgla)” prowadzące do chloroplastu (tylakoidy i chlorofil).\n- Z chloroplastu wydzielona jest produkcja ATP + NADPH (faza jasna).\n- Metabolity te napędzają wytwarzanie glukozy (C₆H₁₂O₆) w cyklu Calvina (faza ciemna).\n- Produktem ubocznym jest O₂ (tlen).\n\nStrzałki pokazują kolejność i powiązania między tymi elementami.
