# DeepResearch Workspace

## Research Workflow
1. Save research notes to `/workspace/notes/` (one file per sub-topic)
2. Track all sources with URLs in notes
3. Write the final report to `/workspace/report.md`

## File Organization
- `/workspace/notes/` — Research notes per topic
- `/workspace/report.md` — Final research report
- `/workspace/sources.md` — Source tracking (optional)
