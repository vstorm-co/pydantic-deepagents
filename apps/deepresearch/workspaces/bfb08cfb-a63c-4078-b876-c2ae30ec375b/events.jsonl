Light independent reactions of photosynthesis are anabolic reactions that lead to the formation of a six-carbon compound, glucose in plants. | The reactants of photosynthesis are light energy, carbon dioxide, and water.\n\nTitle: Photosynthesis: AP\u00ae Biology Crash Course\nURL: https://www.albert.io/blog/photosynthesis-ap-biology-crash-course/\nContent: In Photo system II, light energy from photons splits water into its constituents:two H+ ions,two electrons, and a single oxygen atom in a process known as photolysis. At this stage, we introduce the electron transport chain, which is the mechanism by which electrons are transferred from the thylakoid membrane proteins to the NADP+ molecule \u2013 all of this occurs to produce ATP and water necessary for the plant\u2019s growth. At this stage, the electrons are further excited by light energy absorbed by the Photo system I. This energy is used to further the proton gradient across the chloroplast membrane, and the electron reduces the NADP+ molecule to NADPH. In the diagram below, the transfer of an electron from excitation by a photon of light energy (far left) through Photo systems II and I, to the formation of ATP and NADPH is depicted.\n\nTitle: Photosynthetic Cells - Photosynthesis, Chloroplast\nURL: https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/photosynthetic-cells-14025371/\nContent: Arrows are used to represent storage or flow of inorganic carbon and organic carbon, or to give directionality to photosynthesis or decomposition processes between land plants, soil, aquatic systems, and the Earth's atmosphere.

Coauthor of *Photosynthesis of Carbon Compounds;...*. ### Why is photosynthesis important? Additionally, almost all the oxygen in the atmosphere is because of the process of photosynthesis. If photosynthesis ceased, there would soon be little food or other organic matter on Earth, most organisms would disappear, and Earth\u2019s atmosphere would eventually become nearly devoid of gaseous oxygen. **photosynthesis**, the process by which green plants and certain other organisms transform light energy into chemical energy. During photosynthesis in green plants, light energy is captured and used to convert water, carbon dioxide, and minerals into oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds. ## Importance of photosynthesis. If photosynthesis ceased, there would soon be little food or other organic matter on Earth. Energy produced by photosynthesis carried out by plants millions of years ago is responsible for the fossil fuels (i.e., coal, oil, and natural gas) that power industrial society.\n\nTitle: Intro to photosynthesis (article)\nURL: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/cellular-energetics/photosynthesis/a/intro-to-photosynthesis\nContent: [Skip to main content](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/cellular-energetics/photosynthesis/a/intro-to-photosynthesis#main-content).
