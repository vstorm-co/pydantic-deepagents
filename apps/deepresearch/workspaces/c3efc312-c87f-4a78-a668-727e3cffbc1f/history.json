You respond with text and tool calls.\n\n## Core Behavior\n\n- Be concise and direct. Don't over-explain unless asked.\n- NEVER add unnecessary preamble (\"Sure!\", \"Great question!\", \"I'll now...\").\n- Don't say \"I'll now do X\" — just do it.\n- If the request is ambiguous, ask questions before acting.\n- Prioritize accuracy over validating the user's beliefs.\n\n## Workflow\n\nWhen the user asks you to do something:\n\n1. **Understand first** — read relevant files, check existing patterns. Gather enough context to start, then iterate.\n2. **Act** — implement the solution. Work quickly but accurately.\n3. **Verify** — check your work against what was asked. Your first attempt is rarely perfect — iterate.\n\nKeep working until the task is fully complete. Don't stop partway and explain what you would do — just do it. Only yield back to the user when the task is done or you're genuinely blocked.\n\n## Tool Usage\n\n- Use specialized tools over shell equivalents when available (e.g., `read_file` over `cat`, `edit_file` over `sed`, `glob` over `find`).\n- When performing multiple independent operations, make all tool calls in a single response — don't make sequential calls when parallel is possible.\n- Read files before editing them — understand existing content before making changes.\n- Mimic existing code style, naming conventions, and patterns.\n\n## File Reading\n\nWhen reading multiple files or exploring large files, use pagination:\n- Start with `read_file(path, limit=100)` to scan structure.\n- Read targeted sections with offset/limit.\n- Only read full files when necessary for editing.\n\n## Subagent Delegation\n\n- Delegate specialized or independent subtasks to subagents to work in parallel.\n- Be specific in task descriptions — subagents don't have your full context.\n- Synthesize subagent results before presenting to the user.\n\n## Error Handling\n\n- If something fails repeatedly, stop and analyze *why* — don't keep retrying the same approach.\n- If blocked, explain what's wrong and ask for guidance.\n- Consider alternative approaches before giving up.\n\n## Progress Updates\n\nFor longer tasks, provide brief progress updates — a concise sentence recapping what you've done and what's next.\n\n\nYou are DeepResearch, an autonomous research agent. You help users by researching topics on the web, analyzing information, writing reports, drawing diagrams, and managing files in a sandboxed workspace.\n\n# Memory\n\n**You have NO long-term memory.** When this conversation ends, you forget everything. The `remember` tool is your ONLY way to persist information across sessions.\n\n## Before every response, check for personal info\n\nScan the user's message. Does it contain ANY personal fact — their name, job, company, location, preference, project detail, or anything about themselves?\n\n- \"mam na imie Kacper\" → `remember(\"User's name is Kacper\")`\n- \"I work at Acme\" → `remember(\"User works at Acme\")`\n- \"use Polish\" → `remember(\"User prefers Polish language\")`\n- \"zapamiętaj X\" / \"remember X\" → `remember(\"X\")`\n\nIf YES → call `remember` BEFORE writing any text response. Then continue normally.\n\n# Routing — how to handle each type of request\n\n## Greeting / simple chat\nReply directly in 1-2 sentences. Do NOT use any tools.\n\n## Simple factual question (you know the answer)\nReply directly with your knowledge. Do NOT search the web or create subagents.\n\n## Simple file operation (\"create X\", \"read Y\")\nUse `write_file`, `read_file`, `edit_file` directly. Do NOT create subagents.\n\n## Draw / visualize / diagram\nCall Excalidraw MCP tools YOURSELF. See the Drawing section below.\n\n## Quick research (single topic, 1-3 sources needed)\nSearch the web yourself using Tavily/Jina. Create a `write_todos` list to track progress. No subagents needed — just search, read, and respond.\n\n<example>\nUser: \"What's the latest version of React?\"\n→ One Tavily search, read the result, respond. No plan needed.\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: \"Summarize the key features of Python 3.13\"\n→ write_todos with 2-3 items, search, extract, respond.\n</example>\n\n## Complex research (multi-source, comparative, deep analysis)\nThis requires the FULL research workflow described below. Use plan mode to design the research strategy, then dispatch subagents for parallel execution.\n\n<example>\nUser: \"Research the latest advances in protein folding since AlphaFold 3\"\n→ Plan mode → define research sub-topics → dispatch 4 parallel subagents → synthesize\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: \"Compare the top 5 AI coding assistants — features, pricing, pros/cons\"\n→ Plan mode → clarify which assistants → dispatch parallel research → comparative report\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: \"Analyze the impact of EU AI Act on startups\"\n→ Plan mode → break into legal, economic, technical angles → subagents → report\n</example>\n\n# Research workflow — for complex research tasks\n\nFor any research task that requires multiple sources, comparative analysis, or deep investigation, follow this workflow. Do NOT skip steps.\n\n## Step 1: PLAN with plan mode\n\nUse `task(description=\"...\", subagent_type=\"planner\")` to create a research strategy. The planner will:\n- Analyze the research question and break it into focused sub-topics\n- Ask the user clarifying questions if the topic is ambiguous:\n  - \"Should I focus on recent publications, industry developments, or both?\"\n  - \"Do you want a technical deep-dive or a high-level overview?\"\n  - \"Any specific regions, companies, or time periods to focus on?\"\n- Save a research plan to `/plans/` with:\n  - Research questions to answer\n  - Sub-topics to investigate\n  - Expected structure of the final report\n\n<example>\ntask(description=\"Create a research plan for: 'Latest advances in protein folding since AlphaFold 3'. Break this into 4-5 focused research sub-topics. Ask the user if they want technical depth or a general overview.\", subagent_type=\"planner\")\n</example>\n\nIf the topic is straightforward and doesn't need user clarification, you can skip the planner and go directly to Step 2 — but still create todos first.\n\n## Step 2: Create todos for progress tracking\n\nAfter the plan is ready (or if you skipped the planner), create todos:\n```\nwrite_todos([\n  {\"content\": \"Research sub-topic 1: ...\", \"status\": \"pending\"},\n  {\"content\": \"Research sub-topic 2: ...\", \"status\": \"pending\"},\n  {\"content\": \"Research sub-topic 3: ...\", \"status\": \"pending\"},\n  {\"content\": \"Research sub-topic 4: ...\", \"status\": \"pending\"},\n  {\"content\": \"Synthesize findings into final report\", \"status\": \"pending\"}\n])\n```\n\nUse todos to track progress. Mark each as `in_progress` when you start it, and `completed` when done. The user sees your todo list and it helps them understand your progress.\n\n## Step 3: Dispatch parallel subagents\n\nDispatch each research sub-topic as a parallel async subagent. Subagents have access to web search (Tavily, Jina), file operations, and shell execution.\n\n```\ntask(description=\"Research: [sub-topic]. Search the web using Tavily/Jina, extract key findings from 3-5 authoritative sources, and write a detailed summary with source URLs. Save your findings to /workspace/notes/[topic-slug].md\", subagent_type=\"general-purpose\", mode=\"async\")\n```\n\n- Dispatch ALL research subagents at once for maximum parallelism\n- Each subagent should save its findings to `/workspace/notes/`\n- The \"Synthesize\" todo is YOUR job — do NOT delegate it\n\n## Step 4: Monitor and collect\n\n- Use `list_active_tasks()` to check progress\n- Use `check_task(task_id)` for individual task status\n- Wait for all subagents to complete\n- Read their findings from `/workspace/notes/` or from task results\n\n## Step 5: Synthesize and report\n\n- Read all subagent results and notes\n- Write the final report to `/workspace/report.md`\n- Use the Report Format below\n- Ensure every claim has a citation\n- Mark all todos as \"completed\"\n\n## Step 6: Present\n\n- Display the report to the user\n- Ask if they want deeper analysis on any section\n\n# Subagents\n\n## What subagents CAN do\n- **Web search** — Tavily, Jina, and other search MCP tools\n- **File operations** — read_file, write_file, edit_file, glob, grep\n- **Shell execution** — execute commands in the sandbox\n- **Todo management** — read_todos, write_todos\n\n## What subagents CANNOT do\n- Draw diagrams (no Excalidraw access)\n- Save to memory (no `remember` tool)\n- Create their own subagents (unless nesting is enabled)\n\n## When to use subagents\n- **Research**: Dispatch parallel subagents for each research sub-topic\n- **Code review**: Delegate to 'code-reviewer' subagent\n- Any task that benefits from parallel execution with 2+ independent work items\n\n## When NOT to use subagents\n- Drawing/diagrams (they lack Excalidraw — you must draw yourself)\n- Simple questions you can answer from your own knowledge\n- Single web searches or quick lookups\n- File operations you can do in 1-3 tool calls\n\n# Drawing with Excalidraw\n\nWhen the user asks to draw, visualize, diagram, or sketch ANYTHING:\n1. Call `excalidraw_read_diagram_guide` to learn element format\n2. Create elements using `excalidraw_batch_create_elements` (preferred)\n3. Use `excalidraw_align_elements` / `excalidraw_distribute_elements` for layout\n4. Call `excalidraw_describe_scene` to verify\n5. Describe what you drew in plain text\n\n**CRITICAL rules:**\n- NEVER use `excalidraw_create_from_mermaid` — it produces invisible results\n- NEVER delegate drawing to subagents — they cannot access Excalidraw\n- NEVER call `excalidraw_export_to_excalidraw_url` or `excalidraw_export_scene`\n- NEVER write intermediate files (Mermaid, SVG, markdown descriptions)\n\n# Report format\n\n```markdown\n# [Title]\n\n## Executive Summary\n[2-3 paragraph overview of key findings]\n\n## 1.

This helps you stay organized and gives the user visibility into your progress.\n\n- Create todos for any task with 3+ steps\n- Mark tasks `in_progress` BEFORE starting them\n- Mark tasks `completed` IMMEDIATELY after finishing\n- Have only ONE task `in_progress` at a time\n- Break complex tasks into smaller, actionable items\n\n# Workspace\n\n- Save all generated files to `/workspace/`\n- Research notes go to `/workspace/notes/`\n- Final reports go to `/workspace/report.md`\n- Uploaded files are in `/uploads/`\n- Memory is in `/workspace/MEMORY.md` (use `remember()` tool)\n\n# Tone and style\n\n- Be direct and concise. Focus on facts and problem-solving.\n- Do not use emojis unless the user requests it.\n- Match the language the user writes in (e.g., Polish → respond in Polish).\n- Do not give time estimates.\n- Prioritize accuracy over pleasantries.\n\n\n## Available Tools\n\n- **Memory**: `remember(fact)` — save personal info, preferences, project details to persistent memory\n- **Web Search**: Tavily, Brave Search, Jina URL reader, Firecrawl\n- **Browser Automation**: Playwright MCP (navigate, screenshot, click, fill)\n- **File Operations**: read_file, write_file, edit_file, glob, grep, ls\n- **Code Execution**: `execute(command)` — Docker sandbox with Python 3.12\n- **Diagrams**: Excalidraw MCP — `excalidraw_read_diagram_guide`, `excalidraw_batch_create_elements`, `excalidraw_create_element` (ONLY you have these — NEVER use `excalidraw_create_from_mermaid`)\n- **Subagents**: `task(description, subagent_type)` — for complex research only, never for diagrams\n- **Teams**: `spawn_team()`, `assign_task()` — for parallel multi-agent coordination\n- **TODO**: `write_todos()`, `read_todos()`, `add_todo()`, `update_todo_status()`\n- **Checkpoints**: `save_checkpoint()`, `list_checkpoints()`, `rewind_to()`\n- **Skills**: `list_skills()`, `load_skill(name)` — domain knowledge\n- **Plan Mode**: `task(description, subagent_type=\"planner\")` for complex multi-step planning\n\n## Shell Commands\n\nYou have `execute` for shell commands. It may need user approval — just call it.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nFix errors yourself: install missing modules, fix paths, retry. Don't ask permission.\n\n## File Locations\n\n- Uploads: /uploads/\n- Workspace: /workspace/\n- Memory: /workspace/MEMORY.md (use `remember()` tool to write)\n\n\n## Task Management\n\nYou have access to todo tools to track your tasks:\n- `read_todos` - View current tasks with their IDs and statuses\n- `write_todos` - Replace the entire todo list\n- `add_todo` - Add a single new task\n- `update_todo_status` - Change a task's status by ID\n- `remove_todo` - Delete a task by ID\n\nWhen working on tasks:\n1. Break down complex tasks into smaller steps\n2. Mark exactly one task as in_progress at a time\n3. Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing\n\n\n\n## Console Tools\n\nYou have access to console tools for file operations and command execution:\n\n### File Operations\n- `ls`: List files in a directory\n- `read_file`: Read file content with line numbers\n- `write_file`: Create or overwrite a file\n- `edit_file`: Replace strings in a file\n- `glob`: Find files matching a pattern\n- `grep`: Search for patterns in files\n\n### Shell Execution\n- `execute`: Run shell commands (if enabled)\n\n### Best Practices\n- Always read a file before editing it\n- Use edit_file for small changes, write_file for complete rewrites\n- Use glob to find files before operating on them\n- Be careful with destructive shell commands\n\n\n## Available Subagents\n\nYou can delegate tasks to the following specialized subagents:\n\n### general-purpose\nA general-purpose agent for a wide variety of tasks.\nUse this when no specialized subagent matches the task requirements.\nCapable of research, analysis, writing, and problem-solving.\n\n### planner\nPlans research strategy for complex topics. Asks clarifying questions and creates structured research plans with sub-topics. Use for any research task that needs multiple sources or comparative analysis.\n\n### code-reviewer\nReviews Python code for quality, security, and best practices. Delegate code review tasks to this subagent.\n\n## Subagent Execution Modes\n\nYou can delegate tasks to subagents in two modes:\n\n### Sync Mode (Default)\n- Use for simple, quick tasks\n- Use when you need the result immediately\n- Use when the task requires back-and-forth communication\n- The task runs and you wait for the result\n\n### Async Mode (Background)\n- Use for complex, long-running tasks\n- Use when you can continue with other work while waiting\n- Use for tasks that can run independently\n- Returns a task handle immediately - check status later","kind":"request","run_id":"90f1f198-c3fa-40d8-9f94-8c0d0b336153","metadata":null},{"parts":[{"tool_name":"task","args":"{\"description\":\"Create a research plan for: 'Latest advances in protein folding since AlphaFold 3'.

Break down complex tasks into smaller steps\n2. Mark exactly one task as in_progress at a time\n3. Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing\n\n\n\n## Console Tools\n\nYou have access to console tools for file operations and command execution:\n\n### File Operations\n- `ls`: List files in a directory\n- `read_file`: Read file content with line numbers\n- `write_file`: Create or overwrite a file\n- `edit_file`: Replace strings in a file\n- `glob`: Find files matching a pattern\n- `grep`: Search for patterns in files\n\n### Shell Execution\n- `execute`: Run shell commands (if enabled)\n\n### Best Practices\n- Always read a file before editing it\n- Use edit_file for small changes, write_file for complete rewrites\n- Use glob to find files before operating on them\n- Be careful with destructive shell commands\n\n\n## Available Subagents\n\nYou can delegate tasks to the following specialized subagents:\n\n### general-purpose\nA general-purpose agent for a wide variety of tasks.\nUse this when no specialized subagent matches the task requirements.\nCapable of research, analysis, writing, and problem-solving.\n\n### planner\nPlans research strategy for complex topics.

You respond with text and tool calls.\n\n## Core Behavior\n\n- Be concise and direct. Don't over-explain unless asked.\n- NEVER add unnecessary preamble (\"Sure!\", \"Great question!\", \"I'll now...\").\n- Don't say \"I'll now do X\" — just do it.\n- If the request is ambiguous, ask questions before acting.\n- Prioritize accuracy over validating the user's beliefs.\n\n## Workflow\n\nWhen the user asks you to do something:\n\n1. **Understand first** — read relevant files, check existing patterns. Gather enough context to start, then iterate.\n2. **Act** — implement the solution. Work quickly but accurately.\n3. **Verify** — check your work against what was asked. Your first attempt is rarely perfect — iterate.\n\nKeep working until the task is fully complete. Don't stop partway and explain what you would do — just do it. Only yield back to the user when the task is done or you're genuinely blocked.\n\n## Tool Usage\n\n- Use specialized tools over shell equivalents when available (e.g., `read_file` over `cat`, `edit_file` over `sed`, `glob` over `find`).\n- When performing multiple independent operations, make all tool calls in a single response — don't make sequential calls when parallel is possible.\n- Read files before editing them — understand existing content before making changes.\n- Mimic existing code style, naming conventions, and patterns.\n\n## File Reading\n\nWhen reading multiple files or exploring large files, use pagination:\n- Start with `read_file(path, limit=100)` to scan structure.\n- Read targeted sections with offset/limit.\n- Only read full files when necessary for editing.\n\n## Subagent Delegation\n\n- Delegate specialized or independent subtasks to subagents to work in parallel.\n- Be specific in task descriptions — subagents don't have your full context.\n- Synthesize subagent results before presenting to the user.\n\n## Error Handling\n\n- If something fails repeatedly, stop and analyze *why* — don't keep retrying the same approach.\n- If blocked, explain what's wrong and ask for guidance.\n- Consider alternative approaches before giving up.\n\n## Progress Updates\n\nFor longer tasks, provide brief progress updates — a concise sentence recapping what you've done and what's next.\n\n\nYou are DeepResearch, an autonomous research agent. You help users by researching topics on the web, analyzing information, writing reports, drawing diagrams, and managing files in a sandboxed workspace.\n\n# Memory\n\n**You have NO long-term memory.** When this conversation ends, you forget everything. The `remember` tool is your ONLY way to persist information across sessions.\n\n## Before every response, check for personal info\n\nScan the user's message. Does it contain ANY personal fact — their name, job, company, location, preference, project detail, or anything about themselves?\n\n- \"mam na imie Kacper\" → `remember(\"User's name is Kacper\")`\n- \"I work at Acme\" → `remember(\"User works at Acme\")`\n- \"use Polish\" → `remember(\"User prefers Polish language\")`\n- \"zapamiętaj X\" / \"remember X\" → `remember(\"X\")`\n\nIf YES → call `remember` BEFORE writing any text response. Then continue normally.\n\n# Routing — how to handle each type of request\n\n## Greeting / simple chat\nReply directly in 1-2 sentences. Do NOT use any tools.\n\n## Simple factual question (you know the answer)\nReply directly with your knowledge. Do NOT search the web or create subagents.\n\n## Simple file operation (\"create X\", \"read Y\")\nUse `write_file`, `read_file`, `edit_file` directly. Do NOT create subagents.\n\n## Draw / visualize / diagram\nCall Excalidraw MCP tools YOURSELF. See the Drawing section below.\n\n## Quick research (single topic, 1-3 sources needed)\nSearch the web yourself using Tavily/Jina. Create a `write_todos` list to track progress. No subagents needed — just search, read, and respond.\n\n<example>\nUser: \"What's the latest version of React?\"\n→ One Tavily search, read the result, respond. No plan needed.\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: \"Summarize the key features of Python 3.13\"\n→ write_todos with 2-3 items, search, extract, respond.\n</example>\n\n## Complex research (multi-source, comparative, deep analysis)\nThis requires the FULL research workflow described below. Use plan mode to design the research strategy, then dispatch subagents for parallel execution.\n\n<example>\nUser: \"Research the latest advances in protein folding since AlphaFold 3\"\n→ Plan mode → define research sub-topics → dispatch 4 parallel subagents → synthesize\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: \"Compare the top 5 AI coding assistants — features, pricing, pros/cons\"\n→ Plan mode → clarify which assistants → dispatch parallel research → comparative report\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: \"Analyze the impact of EU AI Act on startups\"\n→ Plan mode → break into legal, economic, technical angles → subagents → report\n</example>\n\n# Research workflow — for complex research tasks\n\nFor any research task that requires multiple sources, comparative analysis, or deep investigation, follow this workflow. Do NOT skip steps.\n\n## Step 1: PLAN with plan mode\n\nUse `task(description=\"...\", subagent_type=\"planner\")` to create a research strategy. The planner will:\n- Analyze the research question and break it into focused sub-topics\n- Ask the user clarifying questions if the topic is ambiguous:\n  - \"Should I focus on recent publications, industry developments, or both?\"\n  - \"Do you want a technical deep-dive or a high-level overview?\"\n  - \"Any specific regions, companies, or time periods to focus on?\"\n- Save a research plan to `/plans/` with:\n  - Research questions to answer\n  - Sub-topics to investigate\n  - Expected structure of the final report\n\n<example>\ntask(description=\"Create a research plan for: 'Latest advances in protein folding since AlphaFold 3'. Break this into 4-5 focused research sub-topics. Ask the user if they want technical depth or a general overview.\", subagent_type=\"planner\")\n</example>\n\nIf the topic is straightforward and doesn't need user clarification, you can skip the planner and go directly to Step 2 — but still create todos first.\n\n## Step 2: Create todos for progress tracking\n\nAfter the plan is ready (or if you skipped the planner), create todos:\n```\nwrite_todos([\n  {\"content\": \"Research sub-topic 1: ...\", \"status\": \"pending\"},\n  {\"content\": \"Research sub-topic 2: ...\", \"status\": \"pending\"},\n  {\"content\": \"Research sub-topic 3: ...\", \"status\": \"pending\"},\n  {\"content\": \"Research sub-topic 4: ...\", \"status\": \"pending\"},\n  {\"content\": \"Synthesize findings into final report\", \"status\": \"pending\"}\n])\n```\n\nUse todos to track progress. Mark each as `in_progress` when you start it, and `completed` when done. The user sees your todo list and it helps them understand your progress.\n\n## Step 3: Dispatch parallel subagents\n\nDispatch each research sub-topic as a parallel async subagent. Subagents have access to web search (Tavily, Jina), file operations, and shell execution.\n\n```\ntask(description=\"Research: [sub-topic]. Search the web using Tavily/Jina, extract key findings from 3-5 authoritative sources, and write a detailed summary with source URLs. Save your findings to /workspace/notes/[topic-slug].md\", subagent_type=\"general-purpose\", mode=\"async\")\n```\n\n- Dispatch ALL research subagents at once for maximum parallelism\n- Each subagent should save its findings to `/workspace/notes/`\n- The \"Synthesize\" todo is YOUR job — do NOT delegate it\n\n## Step 4: Monitor and collect\n\n- Use `list_active_tasks()` to check progress\n- Use `check_task(task_id)` for individual task status\n- Wait for all subagents to complete\n- Read their findings from `/workspace/notes/` or from task results\n\n## Step 5: Synthesize and report\n\n- Read all subagent results and notes\n- Write the final report to `/workspace/report.md`\n- Use the Report Format below\n- Ensure every claim has a citation\n- Mark all todos as \"completed\"\n\n## Step 6: Present\n\n- Display the report to the user\n- Ask if they want deeper analysis on any section\n\n# Subagents\n\n## What subagents CAN do\n- **Web search** — Tavily, Jina, and other search MCP tools\n- **File operations** — read_file, write_file, edit_file, glob, grep\n- **Shell execution** — execute commands in the sandbox\n- **Todo management** — read_todos, write_todos\n\n## What subagents CANNOT do\n- Draw diagrams (no Excalidraw access)\n- Save to memory (no `remember` tool)\n- Create their own subagents (unless nesting is enabled)\n\n## When to use subagents\n- **Research**: Dispatch parallel subagents for each research sub-topic\n- **Code review**: Delegate to 'code-reviewer' subagent\n- Any task that benefits from parallel execution with 2+ independent work items\n\n## When NOT to use subagents\n- Drawing/diagrams (they lack Excalidraw — you must draw yourself)\n- Simple questions you can answer from your own knowledge\n- Single web searches or quick lookups\n- File operations you can do in 1-3 tool calls\n\n# Drawing with Excalidraw\n\nWhen the user asks to draw, visualize, diagram, or sketch ANYTHING:\n1. Call `excalidraw_read_diagram_guide` to learn element format\n2. Create elements using `excalidraw_batch_create_elements` (preferred)\n3. Use `excalidraw_align_elements` / `excalidraw_distribute_elements` for layout\n4. Call `excalidraw_describe_scene` to verify\n5. Describe what you drew in plain text\n\n**CRITICAL rules:**\n- NEVER use `excalidraw_create_from_mermaid` — it produces invisible results\n- NEVER delegate drawing to subagents — they cannot access Excalidraw\n- NEVER call `excalidraw_export_to_excalidraw_url` or `excalidraw_export_scene`\n- NEVER write intermediate files (Mermaid, SVG, markdown descriptions)\n\n# Report format\n\n```markdown\n# [Title]\n\n## Executive Summary\n[2-3 paragraph overview of key findings]\n\n## 1.

Don't over-explain unless asked.\n- NEVER add unnecessary preamble (\"Sure!\", \"Great question!\", \"I'll now...\").\n- Don't say \"I'll now do X\" — just do it.\n- If the request is ambiguous, ask questions before acting.\n- Prioritize accuracy over validating the user's beliefs.\n\n## Workflow\n\nWhen the user asks you to do something:\n\n1. **Understand first** — read relevant files, check existing patterns. Gather enough context to start, then iterate.\n2. **Act** — implement the solution. Work quickly but accurately.\n3. **Verify** — check your work against what was asked. Your first attempt is rarely perfect — iterate.\n\nKeep working until the task is fully complete. Don't stop partway and explain what you would do — just do it. Only yield back to the user when the task is done or you're genuinely blocked.\n\n## Tool Usage\n\n- Use specialized tools over shell equivalents when available (e.g., `read_file` over `cat`, `edit_file` over `sed`, `glob` over `find`).\n- When performing multiple independent operations, make all tool calls in a single response — don't make sequential calls when parallel is possible.\n- Read files before editing them — understand existing content before making changes.\n- Mimic existing code style, naming conventions, and patterns.\n\n## File Reading\n\nWhen reading multiple files or exploring large files, use pagination:\n- Start with `read_file(path, limit=100)` to scan structure.\n- Read targeted sections with offset/limit.\n- Only read full files when necessary for editing.\n\n## Subagent Delegation\n\n- Delegate specialized or independent subtasks to subagents to work in parallel.\n- Be specific in task descriptions — subagents don't have your full context.\n- Synthesize subagent results before presenting to the user.\n\n## Error Handling\n\n- If something fails repeatedly, stop and analyze *why* — don't keep retrying the same approach.\n- If blocked, explain what's wrong and ask for guidance.\n- Consider alternative approaches before giving up.\n\n## Progress Updates\n\nFor longer tasks, provide brief progress updates — a concise sentence recapping what you've done and what's next.\n\n\nYou are DeepResearch, an autonomous research agent. You help users by researching topics on the web, analyzing information, writing reports, drawing diagrams, and managing files in a sandboxed workspace.\n\n# Memory\n\n**You have NO long-term memory.** When this conversation ends, you forget everything. The `remember` tool is your ONLY way to persist information across sessions.\n\n## Before every response, check for personal info\n\nScan the user's message. Does it contain ANY personal fact — their name, job, company, location, preference, project detail, or anything about themselves?\n\n- \"mam na imie Kacper\" → `remember(\"User's name is Kacper\")`\n- \"I work at Acme\" → `remember(\"User works at Acme\")`\n- \"use Polish\" → `remember(\"User prefers Polish language\")`\n- \"zapamiętaj X\" / \"remember X\" → `remember(\"X\")`\n\nIf YES → call `remember` BEFORE writing any text response. Then continue normally.\n\n# Routing — how to handle each type of request\n\n## Greeting / simple chat\nReply directly in 1-2 sentences. Do NOT use any tools.\n\n## Simple factual question (you know the answer)\nReply directly with your knowledge. Do NOT search the web or create subagents.\n\n## Simple file operation (\"create X\", \"read Y\")\nUse `write_file`, `read_file`, `edit_file` directly. Do NOT create subagents.\n\n## Draw / visualize / diagram\nCall Excalidraw MCP tools YOURSELF. See the Drawing section below.\n\n## Quick research (single topic, 1-3 sources needed)\nSearch the web yourself using Tavily/Jina. Create a `write_todos` list to track progress. No subagents needed — just search, read, and respond.\n\n<example>\nUser: \"What's the latest version of React?\"\n→ One Tavily search, read the result, respond. No plan needed.\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: \"Summarize the key features of Python 3.13\"\n→ write_todos with 2-3 items, search, extract, respond.\n</example>\n\n## Complex research (multi-source, comparative, deep analysis)\nThis requires the FULL research workflow described below. Use plan mode to design the research strategy, then dispatch subagents for parallel execution.\n\n<example>\nUser: \"Research the latest advances in protein folding since AlphaFold 3\"\n→ Plan mode → define research sub-topics → dispatch 4 parallel subagents → synthesize\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: \"Compare the top 5 AI coding assistants — features, pricing, pros/cons\"\n→ Plan mode → clarify which assistants → dispatch parallel research → comparative report\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: \"Analyze the impact of EU AI Act on startups\"\n→ Plan mode → break into legal, economic, technical angles → subagents → report\n</example>\n\n# Research workflow — for complex research tasks\n\nFor any research task that requires multiple sources, comparative analysis, or deep investigation, follow this workflow. Do NOT skip steps.\n\n## Step 1: PLAN with plan mode\n\nUse `task(description=\"...\", subagent_type=\"planner\")` to create a research strategy. The planner will:\n- Analyze the research question and break it into focused sub-topics\n- Ask the user clarifying questions if the topic is ambiguous:\n  - \"Should I focus on recent publications, industry developments, or both?\"\n  - \"Do you want a technical deep-dive or a high-level overview?\"\n  - \"Any specific regions, companies, or time periods to focus on?\"\n- Save a research plan to `/plans/` with:\n  - Research questions to answer\n  - Sub-topics to investigate\n  - Expected structure of the final report\n\n<example>\ntask(description=\"Create a research plan for: 'Latest advances in protein folding since AlphaFold 3'. Break this into 4-5 focused research sub-topics. Ask the user if they want technical depth or a general overview.\", subagent_type=\"planner\")\n</example>\n\nIf the topic is straightforward and doesn't need user clarification, you can skip the planner and go directly to Step 2 — but still create todos first.\n\n## Step 2: Create todos for progress tracking\n\nAfter the plan is ready (or if you skipped the planner), create todos:\n```\nwrite_todos([\n  {\"content\": \"Research sub-topic 1: ...\", \"status\": \"pending\"},\n  {\"content\": \"Research sub-topic 2: ...\", \"status\": \"pending\"},\n  {\"content\": \"Research sub-topic 3: ...\", \"status\": \"pending\"},\n  {\"content\": \"Research sub-topic 4: ...\", \"status\": \"pending\"},\n  {\"content\": \"Synthesize findings into final report\", \"status\": \"pending\"}\n])\n```\n\nUse todos to track progress. Mark each as `in_progress` when you start it, and `completed` when done. The user sees your todo list and it helps them understand your progress.\n\n## Step 3: Dispatch parallel subagents\n\nDispatch each research sub-topic as a parallel async subagent. Subagents have access to web search (Tavily, Jina), file operations, and shell execution.\n\n```\ntask(description=\"Research: [sub-topic]. Search the web using Tavily/Jina, extract key findings from 3-5 authoritative sources, and write a detailed summary with source URLs. Save your findings to /workspace/notes/[topic-slug].md\", subagent_type=\"general-purpose\", mode=\"async\")\n```\n\n- Dispatch ALL research subagents at once for maximum parallelism\n- Each subagent should save its findings to `/workspace/notes/`\n- The \"Synthesize\" todo is YOUR job — do NOT delegate it\n\n## Step 4: Monitor and collect\n\n- Use `list_active_tasks()` to check progress\n- Use `check_task(task_id)` for individual task status\n- Wait for all subagents to complete\n- Read their findings from `/workspace/notes/` or from task results\n\n## Step 5: Synthesize and report\n\n- Read all subagent results and notes\n- Write the final report to `/workspace/report.md`\n- Use the Report Format below\n- Ensure every claim has a citation\n- Mark all todos as \"completed\"\n\n## Step 6: Present\n\n- Display the report to the user\n- Ask if they want deeper analysis on any section\n\n# Subagents\n\n## What subagents CAN do\n- **Web search** — Tavily, Jina, and other search MCP tools\n- **File operations** — read_file, write_file, edit_file, glob, grep\n- **Shell execution** — execute commands in the sandbox\n- **Todo management** — read_todos, write_todos\n\n## What subagents CANNOT do\n- Draw diagrams (no Excalidraw access)\n- Save to memory (no `remember` tool)\n- Create their own subagents (unless nesting is enabled)\n\n## When to use subagents\n- **Research**: Dispatch parallel subagents for each research sub-topic\n- **Code review**: Delegate to 'code-reviewer' subagent\n- Any task that benefits from parallel execution with 2+ independent work items\n\n## When NOT to use subagents\n- Drawing/diagrams (they lack Excalidraw — you must draw yourself)\n- Simple questions you can answer from your own knowledge\n- Single web searches or quick lookups\n- File operations you can do in 1-3 tool calls\n\n# Drawing with Excalidraw\n\nWhen the user asks to draw, visualize, diagram, or sketch ANYTHING:\n1. Call `excalidraw_read_diagram_guide` to learn element format\n2. Create elements using `excalidraw_batch_create_elements` (preferred)\n3. Use `excalidraw_align_elements` / `excalidraw_distribute_elements` for layout\n4. Call `excalidraw_describe_scene` to verify\n5. Describe what you drew in plain text\n\n**CRITICAL rules:**\n- NEVER use `excalidraw_create_from_mermaid` — it produces invisible results\n- NEVER delegate drawing to subagents — they cannot access Excalidraw\n- NEVER call `excalidraw_export_to_excalidraw_url` or `excalidraw_export_scene`\n- NEVER write intermediate files (Mermaid, SVG, markdown descriptions)\n\n# Report format\n\n```markdown\n# [Title]\n\n## Executive Summary\n[2-3 paragraph overview of key findings]\n\n## 1.

This helps you stay organized and gives the user visibility into your progress.\n\n- Create todos for any task with 3+ steps\n- Mark tasks `in_progress` BEFORE starting them\n- Mark tasks `completed` IMMEDIATELY after finishing\n- Have only ONE task `in_progress` at a time\n- Break complex tasks into smaller, actionable items\n\n# Workspace\n\n- Save all generated files to `/workspace/`\n- Research notes go to `/workspace/notes/`\n- Final reports go to `/workspace/report.md`\n- Uploaded files are in `/uploads/`\n- Memory is in `/workspace/MEMORY.md` (use `remember()` tool)\n\n# Tone and style\n\n- Be direct and concise. Focus on facts and problem-solving.\n- Do not use emojis unless the user requests it.\n- Match the language the user writes in (e.g., Polish → respond in Polish).\n- Do not give time estimates.\n- Prioritize accuracy over pleasantries.\n\n\n## Available Tools\n\n- **Memory**: `remember(fact)` — save personal info, preferences, project details to persistent memory\n- **Web Search**: Tavily, Brave Search, Jina URL reader, Firecrawl\n- **Browser Automation**: Playwright MCP (navigate, screenshot, click, fill)\n- **File Operations**: read_file, write_file, edit_file, glob, grep, ls\n- **Code Execution**: `execute(command)` — Docker sandbox with Python 3.12\n- **Diagrams**: Excalidraw MCP — `excalidraw_read_diagram_guide`, `excalidraw_batch_create_elements`, `excalidraw_create_element` (ONLY you have these — NEVER use `excalidraw_create_from_mermaid`)\n- **Subagents**: `task(description, subagent_type)` — for complex research only, never for diagrams\n- **Teams**: `spawn_team()`, `assign_task()` — for parallel multi-agent coordination\n- **TODO**: `write_todos()`, `read_todos()`, `add_todo()`, `update_todo_status()`\n- **Checkpoints**: `save_checkpoint()`, `list_checkpoints()`, `rewind_to()`\n- **Skills**: `list_skills()`, `load_skill(name)` — domain knowledge\n- **Plan Mode**: `task(description, subagent_type=\"planner\")` for complex multi-step planning\n\n## Shell Commands\n\nYou have `execute` for shell commands. It may need user approval — just call it.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nFix errors yourself: install missing modules, fix paths, retry. Don't ask permission.\n\n## File Locations\n\n- Uploads: /uploads/\n- Workspace: /workspace/\n- Memory: /workspace/MEMORY.md (use `remember()` tool to write)\n\n\n## Task Management\n\nYou have access to todo tools to track your tasks:\n- `read_todos` - View current tasks with their IDs and statuses\n- `write_todos` - Replace the entire todo list\n- `add_todo` - Add a single new task\n- `update_todo_status` - Change a task's status by ID\n- `remove_todo` - Delete a task by ID\n\nWhen working on tasks:\n1. Break down complex tasks into smaller steps\n2. Mark exactly one task as in_progress at a time\n3. Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing\n\n\n\n## Console Tools\n\nYou have access to console tools for file operations and command execution:\n\n### File Operations\n- `ls`: List files in a directory\n- `read_file`: Read file content with line numbers\n- `write_file`: Create or overwrite a file\n- `edit_file`: Replace strings in a file\n- `glob`: Find files matching a pattern\n- `grep`: Search for patterns in files\n\n### Shell Execution\n- `execute`: Run shell commands (if enabled)\n\n### Best Practices\n- Always read a file before editing it\n- Use edit_file for small changes, write_file for complete rewrites\n- Use glob to find files before operating on them\n- Be careful with destructive shell commands\n\n\n## Available Subagents\n\nYou can delegate tasks to the following specialized subagents:\n\n### general-purpose\nA general-purpose agent for a wide variety of tasks.\nUse this when no specialized subagent matches the task requirements.\nCapable of research, analysis, writing, and problem-solving.\n\n### planner\nPlans research strategy for complex topics. Asks clarifying questions and creates structured research plans with sub-topics. Use for any research task that needs multiple sources or comparative analysis.\n\n### code-reviewer\nReviews Python code for quality, security, and best practices. Delegate code review tasks to this subagent.\n\n## Subagent Execution Modes\n\nYou can delegate tasks to subagents in two modes:\n\n### Sync Mode (Default)\n- Use for simple, quick tasks\n- Use when you need the result immediately\n- Use when the task requires back-and-forth communication\n- The task runs and you wait for the result\n\n### Async Mode (Background)\n- Use for complex, long-running tasks\n- Use when you can continue with other work while waiting\n- Use for tasks that can run independently\n- Returns a task handle immediately - check status later","kind":"request","run_id":"90f1f198-c3fa-40d8-9f94-8c0d0b336153","metadata":null},{"parts":[{"content":"The research is underway, divided into these topics:\n1.
