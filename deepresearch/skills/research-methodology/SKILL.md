# Research Methodology Guide

## Search Strategy

### Phase 1: Broad Discovery
- Start with general queries to understand the landscape
- Use different phrasings for the same concept
- Note key terminology, authors, and organizations

### Phase 2: Focused Deep-Dive
- Search for specific claims, statistics, or technical details
- Target authoritative sources identified in Phase 1
- Use exact phrases in quotes for precision

### Phase 3: Verification
- Cross-reference key claims across multiple sources
- Search for counter-arguments or contradictions
- Check publication dates for recency

## Source Evaluation

### Reliability Hierarchy
1. **Academic papers** (peer-reviewed journals, arXiv preprints)
2. **Official documentation** (government, organization, project docs)
3. **Reputable news** (established outlets with editorial standards)
4. **Expert blog posts** (known authors with credentials)
5. **Community forums** (Stack Overflow, Reddit — use cautiously)

### Evaluation Checklist
- **Authority**: Who wrote it? What are their credentials?
- **Currency**: When was it published? Is it still relevant?
- **Coverage**: Does it address the topic comprehensively?
- **Accuracy**: Can claims be verified elsewhere?
- **Objectivity**: Is there obvious bias or commercial interest?

## Note-Taking Best Practices

### Structure Each Note File
```markdown
# [Sub-topic Title]

## Key Findings
- Finding 1 [SOURCE: url, accessed YYYY-MM-DD] [HIGH confidence]
- Finding 2 [SOURCE: url, accessed YYYY-MM-DD] [MEDIUM confidence]

## Contradictions
- Source A says X, but Source B says Y

## Gaps
- Could not find reliable data on Z
```

### Confidence Levels
- **[HIGH]**: Multiple authoritative sources agree
- **[MEDIUM]**: Single authoritative source, or multiple less-reliable sources agree
- **[LOW]**: Single non-authoritative source, or conflicting information

## Common Pitfalls
- Don't rely on a single source for important claims
- Check if "recent" articles cite outdated data
- Be wary of sources that don't cite their own sources
- Distinguish between correlation and causation
- Note when sample sizes are small or studies are preliminary
