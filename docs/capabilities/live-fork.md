# Live Run Forking

*git branch, but for cognition.*

**Live Run Forking** splits a running agent into multiple parallel branches that share the same conversation history up to the fork point, then explore different approaches in isolation. The branches run concurrently as `asyncio.Task`s with their own `DeepAgentDeps` (separate backends, todos, message queues). When one finishes, you pick a winner via `merge_or_select(action="pick:<id>")`: the winner's overlay writes are flushed onto the parent backend and the rest of the branches are cancelled with their writes discarded.

This page is the canonical reference for the whole feature; it grows incrementally as stages land.

## Quick start

```python
import asyncio
from pydantic_deep import (
    DeepAgentDeps,
    InMemoryCheckpointStore,
    LiveForkCapability,
    StateBackend,
    create_deep_agent,
)


async def main() -> None:
    agent = create_deep_agent(
        model="anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6",
        forking=LiveForkCapability(),       # opt-in; default is False
        include_checkpoints=True,           # provides the rewind safety net
    )
    deps = DeepAgentDeps(
        backend=StateBackend(),
        checkpoint_store=InMemoryCheckpointStore(),
    )

    result = await agent.run(
        "Use `fork_run` to spawn TWO branches naming a Python library: "
        "Branch A picks a whimsical name, Branch B picks a technical name. "
        "Each branch returns a 5-sentence pitch. After both finish, call "
        "`inspect_branches`, then `merge_or_select(action='pick:<id>')` for "
        "the better pitch.",
        deps=deps,
    )
    print(result.output)


asyncio.run(main())
```

The agent drives the fork itself — `fork_run`, `inspect_branches`, `merge_or_select` are regular tools. There is no CLI surface yet (Stage 3).

## Configuration

### `create_deep_agent()` parameter

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `forking` | `bool \| LiveForkCapability` | `False` | Opt-in: `True` enables defaults (`max_branches=10`, `max_depth=2`, `InMemoryForkStateStore`); pass a configured `LiveForkCapability` for custom limits / store. |

### `LiveForkCapability` knobs

| Knob | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `max_branches` | `int` | `10` | Maximum branches per `fork_run` call. Stage 1 hard-defaulted to `2`; Stage 4 raised the default. |
| `max_depth` | `int` | `2` | Maximum fork nesting depth. Stage 1 hard-defaulted to `1`; Stage 4 raised it so one level of fork-of-fork is allowed. |
| `store` | `ForkStateStore \| None` | `InMemoryForkStateStore()` | Where `ForkHandle` records are persisted for inspection. In-memory only across all stages — process restart loses the state. |
| `keep_artifacts` | `bool` | `False` | Stage 5. When `True`, the on-disk fork directory under `.pydantic-deep/forks/{fork_id}/` is preserved after merge / abort for post-hoc inspection. Independent of apply-on-merge semantics. |

### Per-branch budgets (Stage 4)

[`BranchSpec.budget_usd`][pydantic_deep.types.BranchSpec] is **enforced** as of Stage 4. When a branch's [`CostTracking`][pydantic_ai_shields.CostTracking] cumulative cost crosses its cap, the branch is cancelled and its state transitions to [`"budget_exhausted"`][pydantic_deep.types.BranchState]; siblings keep running.

Pass a fork-wide cap at the `fork_run` call:

```python
await agent.run(
    "Try three approaches with a $5 ceiling",
    deps=deps,
)
# Inside the agent the tool call becomes:
# fork_run(
#     specs=[
#         {"label": "a", "steer": "approach 1", "budget_usd": 2.00},
#         {"label": "b", "steer": "approach 2", "budget_usd": 2.00},
#         {"label": "c", "steer": "approach 3", "budget_usd": 2.00},
#     ],
#     aggregate_budget_usd=5.00,
# )
```

When the sum of branch costs crosses `aggregate_budget_usd`, every still-running branch is terminated with state [`"aggregate_budget_exhausted"`][pydantic_deep.types.BranchState]. See [Limitations](#limitations-non-goals) below for the best-effort caveat.

### Per-branch isolation

[`BranchIsolation`][pydantic_deep.types.BranchIsolation] controls what each branch shares with the parent. Defaults are deliberately conservative — branches see the parent's history but mutate their own backends, todos, and message queues.

| Flag | Default | Stage 1 effect |
|---|---|---|
| `history` | `"copy"` | Always copied. Not configurable. |
| `backend` | `"copy"` | Wraps the parent backend in a [`BranchOverlay`][pydantic_deep.toolsets.forking.isolation.BranchOverlay] — reads fall through, writes land in an overlay. `"share_readonly"` / `"share"` accepted for forward-compat. |
| `memory` | `"copy"` | Recorded; concrete effect lands when memory gets a separate path (Stage 4). |
| `todos` | `"copy"` | Branch starts with an empty todo list. |
| `message_queue` | `"isolated"` | Branch gets a fresh `MessageQueue` — external steering with `>>a` is per-branch (delivered in Stage 3). |
| `team_bus` | `"shared"` | Default-shared so branches can talk via the existing peer-to-peer bus. |

## Agent-facing tools

When `forking` is enabled, the agent gains six tools:

| Tool | Surface |
|---|---|
| `fork_run(specs, isolation=None, strategy=None, aggregate_budget_usd=None)` | Spawn ≤`max_branches` branch tasks (Stage 4 default `10`). Each `spec` needs `label` and `steer`; optional `model`, `budget_usd`, `extra_instructions`. `aggregate_budget_usd` adds a fork-wide cap. |
| `inspect_branches()` | Return current per-branch state: `running`, `done`, `failed`, `terminated`, `budget_exhausted` (Stage 4), `aggregate_budget_exhausted` (Stage 4). |
| `merge_or_select(action)` | Resolve the fork. Stage 1 supports `action="pick:<branch_id>"` only; an exhausted branch can still be picked — see [Capturing partial history](#capturing-partial-history). |
| `terminate_branch(branch_id)` | Cancel one branch's task; the branch transitions to `terminated`. |
| `diff_branches(fork_id, paths=None)` | **Stage 2.** Build a typed [`BranchDiffReport`][pydantic_deep.types.BranchDiffReport] covering every path any branch touched. See [Diff explorer](#diff-explorer). |
| `fork_cost(fork_id)` | **Stage 4.** Return a typed [`ForkCostSummary`][pydantic_deep.types.ForkCostSummary] with per-branch [`BranchCost`][pydantic_deep.types.BranchCost] entries and an aggregate. |

       │
       ▼
   parent run continues with winner's history
```

A fresh `ForkCoordinator` is allocated on every `agent.run()` via [`LiveForkCapability.for_run`][pydantic_deep.capabilities.forking.LiveForkCapability.for_run], so concurrent parent runs of the same agent never share state.

### Checkpoint integration

Forking integrates with [Checkpointing](../advanced/checkpointing.md) to give the user a rewind safety net:

- Before tasks are spawned, the coordinator saves `fork:<id>` containing the parent's pre-fork history.
- After `merge_or_select` resolves, it saves `post-fork:<id>` containing the winner's merged history.

If `include_checkpoints` is `False`, `fork_run` still works but emits a `UserWarning` — there is no rewind anchor if anything goes wrong.

!!! warning "Pre-fork anchor pruning"
    With `checkpoint_frequency="every_tool"` (the default) and `max_checkpoints=20`, a long fork run can prune the `fork:<id>` anchor before merge resolves. The `ForkHandle.parent_checkpoint_id` still references the (now-evicted) record. If the rewind affordance matters, bump `max_checkpoints` or set `checkpoint_frequency="every_turn"`.

### `BranchOverlay` write tracking

`BranchOverlay.changes()` returns the temporal-ordered `list[FileChange]` of every write in this branch. Stage 2's `diff_branches()` reads this list per branch to build the [`BranchDiffReport`](#diff-explorer); Stage 5's `ForkMaterializer` and Stage 6's judge consume the same API — preserve it across stage upgrades.

### Capturing partial history

When a branch is terminated mid-run — manually via `terminate_branch`, by a per-branch budget watcher (`budget_exhausted`), or by the fork-wide aggregate watcher (`aggregate_budget_exhausted`) — the coordinator keeps a snapshot of the branch's history in `BranchRuntime.partial_history`. That snapshot is captured on every `before_model_request`, so it reflects the state of play just before the most recent model call.

`merge_or_select("pick:<exhausted_id>")` recognises the cancellation, picks up the snapshot, and returns a [`MergeResult`][pydantic_deep.types.MergeResult] with the partial history as `history_after_merge` — rather than raising. This makes a budget-killed branch a usable merge candidate: you keep the work it did before the cap fired.

Caveat: any tool call that was in-flight at termination time is **not** reflected in the snapshot — only completed turns are. When `partial_history` is empty (true cancellation with no model request yet), `merge_or_select` raises `RuntimeError` as before.

## Diff explorer

Once branches are running (or have completed), the agent compares what each branch did to shared files with a single tool call: `diff_branches(fork_id, paths=None)`. The tool returns a typed [`BranchDiffReport`][pydantic_deep.types.BranchDiffReport]; on error (`fork_id` mismatch, forking disabled, no active fork) it returns a short string instead so the agent can self-correct.

Programmatic Python callers (Stage 3 CLI, Stage 6 judge, custom tooling) use the same builder directly via [`build_diff_report`][pydantic_deep.toolsets.forking.diff.build_diff_report]:

```python
from pydantic_deep import build_diff_report

# `coordinator` is the ForkCoordinator allocated by LiveForkCapability.for_run;
# it lives on `deps.fork_coordinator` after the first agent.run().
fork_id = coordinator.fork_id  # bind to a local so the None check narrows
assert fork_id is not None, "no active fork — call fork_run first"
report = build_diff_report(fork_id, list(coordinator.branches.values()))

print(report.summary.agreement_score)        # 1.0 = unanimous, 0.0 = all-split
for pd in report.paths:
    print(pd.path, pd.agreement)             # e.g. "src/app.py split"
    for branch_id, change in pd.branches.items():
        print(" ", branch_id, change.operation)
        print(change.unified_diff_vs_parent)  # stdlib `difflib.unified_diff`
```

Unlike the agent-facing `diff_branches` tool, `build_diff_report` does not validate coordinator state — it builds a report from whatever runtimes you pass. Programmatic callers are expected to check `coordinator.fork_id` themselves before calling. This separation keeps the builder minimal and pushes the string-vs-typed error decision to the caller (typed callers prefer `if coord.fork_id != expected: raise ...` over parsing the tool's error string).

### Report shape

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `BranchDiffReport.fork_id` | Echoed from the active fork. |
| `BranchDiffReport.paths: list[PathDiff]` | One entry per touched path, sorted alphabetically. |
| `BranchDiffReport.summary: DiffSummary` | Aggregate counts and `agreement_score`. |
| `PathDiff.parent_content: str \| None` | Parent backend's content; `None` if the file is new or binary. |
| `PathDiff.branches: dict[str, BranchChange]` | Keyed by branch id; one entry per branch in the fork. |
| `PathDiff.agreement` | One of the four labels below. |
| `BranchChange.unified_diff_vs_parent` | Stdlib unified diff; binary placeholder or truncated preview for large/binary files. |
| `BranchChange.new_content` | Branch's post-write content; `None` for binary, deleted, or untouched. |
| `BranchChange.is_binary` | True when the branch's content contains a null byte in the first 8 KB. |
| `DiffSummary.agreement_score` | `1.0 - split_paths / max(total_paths_touched, 1)`. |

### Agreement classification

For each path, the builder labels how the branches relate:

- `unanimous_change` — ≥2 branches touched the path with identical content.
- `unanimous_no_change` — only surfaces when an explicit `paths` filter includes paths no branch touched (kept for transparency).
- `split` — ≥2 branches touched the path with differing content.
- `unique` — exactly one branch touched the path; counted in `summary.per_branch_unique[branch_id]`.

### Binary and large-file handling

- **Binary content** (null byte in first 8 KB): `is_binary=True`, `new_content=None`, and `unified_diff_vs_parent` becomes a `[binary · {size} · sha256:{12 hex}]` placeholder.
- **Large diffs** (>500 lines): the unified diff is replaced with a head/tail preview using the same `create_content_preview` helper as [`EvictionCapability`](../advanced/eviction.md), with a `... [N lines truncated] ...` marker.

### `paths` filter

Pass `paths=["src/app.py", "src/utils.py"]` to restrict the report to specific paths. Filtered paths that no branch touched still surface as `unanimous_no_change`, so the report stays transparent — silence is never confused with "no diff."

## External diff tool integration

Stage 5 mirrors every branch's working tree to disk in real time so external diff tools (PyCharm, VS Code) can show the user what changed. The materialised layout lives at `.pydantic-deep/forks/{fork_id}/` and is removed on merge resolution unless [`LiveForkCapability(keep_artifacts=True)`][pydantic_deep.capabilities.forking.LiveForkCapability] is set.

```
.pydantic-deep/forks/{fork_id}/
├── manifest.json
├── parent/
│   └── <relative path of every file a branch touched, frozen at fork time>
└── branches/
    ├── approach_a/
    │   └── <same paths, post-branch-write content>
    └── approach_b/
        └── ...
```

Per-branch directories use the human-readable [`BranchSpec.label`][pydantic_deep.types.BranchSpec] (e.g. `approach_a`), not the internal UUID. The parent snapshot under `parent/` is captured lazily — the first time a branch writes a path, the materializer freezes the parent's pre-fork bytes for that path; subsequent parent writes do not update the snapshot.

### Editor detection

[`EditorDetector.detect`][pydantic_deep.toolsets.forking.editor.EditorDetector] picks the first available diff tool in this order:

1. `PYDANTIC_DEEP_DIFFTOOL` env var — explicit override, becomes `kind="custom"`. The template supports `{parent}` and `{branches}` placeholders.
2. `pycharm` on `PATH` → native 3-way diff via a single `subprocess.Popen(["pycharm", "diff", parent, a, b, c])`. For the 2-branch case the parent is passed as the middle argument (`pycharm diff a parent b`) to match PyCharm's 3-way diff "base in the middle" convention.
3. `code` on `PATH` → VS Code pairwise — one `Popen` per branch, each `["code", "--diff", parent, branch]`.
4. TUI fallback (`kind="tui"`) → the in-TUI `MergePickerModal` opens in diff-explore mode; no external process is spawned.

### `/fork diff` command

While a fork is active, the user can launch the detected diff tool from the TUI:

- `/fork diff <path>` — diff the materialised parent vs each branch's snapshot of `<path>`.
- `/fork diff` (no argument) — open a picker listing every touched path and the branches that wrote to it; pick a row + a subset of branches and the external diff tool launches.

This is the only `/fork` sub-command on the active-fork allow-list; bare `/fork` and `/fork-config` stay blocked mid-fork because they would spawn a new run and clobber the coordinator.

The `MergePickerModal` also exposes the "Open in editor" action (key: `o`) — useful when the user is already in the picker and wants to inspect a specific branch's snapshot before deciding.

## Apply on merge

[`ForkCoordinator.merge_or_select`][pydantic_deep.toolsets.forking.coordinator.ForkCoordinator.merge_or_select] picks a winner and **flushes its overlay writes onto the parent backend**. The winner's history is adopted into the parent run; discarded branches' overlays are released without flush.

```python
result = await coordinator.merge_or_select(f"pick:{winner_id}")
# Parent backend now reflects every file the winner wrote, plus a report:
print(result.applied_paths)     # ["cat.md", "dog.md"]
print(result.applied_changes)   # 2
print(result.conflicts)         # [] when parent was untouched during fork
print(result.errors)            # [] on success
```

### Conflict policy: last-write-wins

If a third actor modifies (or deletes) a path on the parent backend between fork time and merge time, the overlay's writes still land on the parent (last-write-wins). The divergence surfaces in [`MergeResult.conflicts`][pydantic_deep.types.MergeResult] so the CLI can warn the user. The merge notification renders as:

```
Merged: kept branch alpha · 2 files applied · conflicts: cat.md
```

Per-write failures (parent `WriteResult.error` non-empty or the backend raises) do not abort `flush_to` — the failing path is excluded from `applied_paths`, recorded in `MergeResult.errors` as a [`FlushError`][pydantic_deep.types.FlushError], and the remaining writes continue.

### Nested forks

When a fork spawns inside another fork (`max_depth=2`), the inner fork's parent backend IS the outer branch's [`BranchOverlay`][pydantic_deep.toolsets.forking.isolation.BranchOverlay]. `flush_to` writing into that overlay correctly propagates the winner's writes up one level; resolving the outer fork later propagates them to the root backend. No special handling required.

!!! warning "Rewind across `post-fork:<id>` does not restore files"
    The `post-fork:<fork_id>` checkpoint captures conversation history only — not file state. After a merge with apply, rewinding via `/load post-fork:<id>` restores the merged history but leaves the winner's file writes on disk. Track and revert them manually if needed. Full file-aware rewind is on the follow-up list.

## CLI integration

Stage 3 ships forking in the Textual TUI (`pydantic-deep` CLI). Once `forking=True` is on the agent — flipped automatically by `create_cli_agent()` — every TUI session can fork the current run.

```text
┌─ pydantic-deep ────────────────────────────────────────┐

### Slash commands

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `/fork` | Open the picker modal, collect `N` `(label, steer)` pairs (where `N = app.fork_branch_count`), spawn branches. Blocked while an agent run is in flight (Esc first, then `/fork`). |
| `/fork-branches N` | Set the branch count used by the next `/fork` (range `[1, max_branches]`; kernel default `10`). Persists to `.pydantic-deep/config.toml`. No arg → print current value. |
| `/fork-budget per-branch <usd>` | Default `budget_usd` prefilled into every branch row in the picker. Persisted. |
| `/fork-budget aggregate <usd>` | Fork-wide budget cap passed to `coordinator.fork(aggregate_budget_usd=…)`. Persisted. |
| `/fork-budget clear` | Reset both budgets to unset. |
| `/fork-model <i> <model>` | Assign a model (must include provider prefix, e.g. `anthropic:claude-opus-4-6`) to branch slot `i` (1-indexed, in `[1, fork_branch_count]`). Visible on the corresponding picker row. Persisted. |
| `/fork-model <i> clear` | Remove the override for branch `i`; that slot falls back to the agent's default model. |
| `/fork-model clear` | Remove every per-branch model override. |
| `/merge` | Open the merge picker — render each branch's diff snippets, pick the winner with `1`/`2`. Adopts the winner's `history_after_merge` into the parent. |

All three configuration commands (`/fork-branches`, `/fork-budget`, `/fork-model`) write through to `.pydantic-deep/config.toml` immediately, so settings survive CLI restarts. They configure the *next* fork — they are intentionally **not** in the active-fork allow-list, so mutating them mid-fork is blocked.

#### Worked example

```text
> /fork-branches 4
fork_branch_count = 4
> /fork-budget per-branch 0.25
per-branch budget = $0.25
> /fork-budget aggregate 2.00
aggregate budget = $2.00
> /fork-model 1 anthropic:claude-opus-4-6
Branch 1 model = anthropic:claude-opus-4-6
> /fork-model 2 openrouter:openai/gpt-4.1
Branch 2 model = openrouter:openai/gpt-4.1
> /fork
# picker opens with 4 rows. Rows 1 and 2 show their assigned models
# above the label/steer/budget inputs; rows 3 and 4 show "(default: …)".
# Every row prefills 0.25 in budget_usd. The aggregate row prefills 2.00.
# Submitting spawns four branches under a $2.00 fork-wide cap.
```

When the cumulative cost across all branches reaches `$2.00`, every still-running branch is terminated with state `aggregate_budget_exhausted` (rendered as the `$$ agg-exhausted` chip in the tab strip).

### Branch tabs

The tab strip shows one chip per branch plus a `+` overview pseudo-tab. Status badges mirror [`BranchStatus.state`][pydantic_deep.types.BranchStatus]: `●` running, `✓` done, `✗` failed, `⊘` terminated. `Tab` cycles focus through `overview → branch 0 → branch 1 → overview`.

### Steering a branch

`MessageQueue` per-branch routing (`message_queue="isolated"`, the default) means each branch has its own queue. The CLI exposes this via the `>>` steer prefix from [Message Queue (#100)](message-queue.md), extended with a branch id / label:

```text
>>a focus on tests
```

routes the message to branch `a`'s queue only. Branch `b` is unaffected. If the label doesn't match a live branch, the input is rejected with a notification — unlike the `!` shell prefix, `>>` is steering-only and never falls through. `!` keeps its #100 meaning during a fork (shell command).

While a fork is active, plain prompts and most slash commands are blocked with a notification. The allow-list is `/merge`, `/help`, `/cost`, `/tokens`, `/version`, `/quit`, `/copy`. Everything else would spawn a new `agent.run()` and silently overwrite `deps.fork_coordinator`.

### Esc semantics

- **On a branch tab:** confirms "terminate `{label}`?" then calls [`ForkCoordinator.terminate_branch`][pydantic_deep.toolsets.forking.coordinator.ForkCoordinator.terminate_branch]. The other branches keep running.
- **On the overview tab:** confirms "abort the entire fork?" then calls [`ForkCoordinator.aclose`][pydantic_deep.toolsets.forking.coordinator.ForkCoordinator.aclose] which cancels every branch task.

Branch tab Esc reuses the same `task.cancel()` mechanism as the existing in-run Esc interrupt (#96).

Once the merge resolves, `app.message_history` is the winner's `history_after_merge`. Stage 1's coordinator has already saved the `post-fork:{fork_id}` checkpoint anchor — `/load` lets you rewind there later.

## API reference

- [`LiveForkCapability`][pydantic_deep.capabilities.forking.LiveForkCapability] — capability registered on the agent. Owns `max_branches`, `max_depth`, `store`, and the per-run [`ForkCoordinator`][pydantic_deep.toolsets.forking.coordinator.ForkCoordinator] allocated via `for_run`.
- [`ForkCoordinator`][pydantic_deep.toolsets.forking.coordinator.ForkCoordinator] — workhorse for a single parent run. Owns branch tasks, serialises mutations via an `asyncio.Lock`, resolves merges by awaiting the picked winner.
- [`BranchOverlay`][pydantic_deep.toolsets.forking.isolation.BranchOverlay] — copy-on-write backend wrapper. Reads fall through to the parent; writes land in an isolated `StateBackend` overlay and are recorded.
- [`clone_for_branch`][pydantic_deep.toolsets.forking.isolation.clone_for_branch] — clones `DeepAgentDeps` per `BranchIsolation` policy.
- [`create_fork_toolset`][pydantic_deep.toolsets.forking.create_fork_toolset] — agent-facing tools factory. Wired automatically by `create_deep_agent(forking=...)`.
- Types: [`BranchSpec`][pydantic_deep.types.BranchSpec], [`BranchIsolation`][pydantic_deep.types.BranchIsolation], [`BranchStatus`][pydantic_deep.types.BranchStatus], [`ForkHandle`][pydantic_deep.types.ForkHandle], [`MergeStrategy`][pydantic_deep.types.MergeStrategy], [`MergeResult`][pydantic_deep.types.MergeResult], [`FileChange`][pydantic_deep.types.FileChange].
- Stage 2 diff types: [`BranchDiffReport`][pydantic_deep.types.BranchDiffReport], [`PathDiff`][pydantic_deep.types.PathDiff], [`BranchChange`][pydantic_deep.types.BranchChange], [`DiffSummary`][pydantic_deep.types.DiffSummary], [`BranchDiffAgreement`][pydantic_deep.types.BranchDiffAgreement], [`BranchDiffOperation`][pydantic_deep.types.BranchDiffOperation].
- Stage 2 builder: [`build_diff_report`][pydantic_deep.toolsets.forking.diff.build_diff_report] — public entry point shared by the `diff_branches` tool and programmatic callers.
- Errors: [`ForkBranchLimitError`][pydantic_deep.toolsets.forking.coordinator.ForkBranchLimitError], [`ForkDepthLimitError`][pydantic_deep.toolsets.forking.coordinator.ForkDepthLimitError].

## Examples

### Programmatic fork (without the agent driving it)

Useful when you want to script fork-and-pick in tests or harnesses:

```python
from pydantic_deep import (
    BranchIsolation,
    BranchSpec,
    DeepAgentDeps,
    LiveForkCapability,
    StateBackend,
    create_deep_agent,
)


fork_cap = LiveForkCapability()
agent = create_deep_agent(model="anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6", forking=fork_cap)
deps = DeepAgentDeps(backend=StateBackend())

# Run once so the capability's for_run() allocates a per-run coordinator.
result = await agent.run("warm up the run loop", deps=deps)
coordinator = deps.fork_coordinator       # set by LiveForkCapability.for_run
assert coordinator is not None

handle = await coordinator.fork(
    [
        BranchSpec(label="conservative", steer="Take the safest approach."),
        BranchSpec(label="aggressive",  steer="Optimise for performance."),
    ],
    parent_history=list(result.all_messages()),
    isolation=BranchIsolation(),          # defaults
)

# ... wait / inspect ...

merge = await coordinator.merge_or_select(f"pick:{handle.branches[0]}")
print(merge.winner_branch_id, len(merge.history_after_merge))
```

### Inspecting overlay writes

Stage 1 already exposes the data spine that Stages 2/5/6 will consume:

```python
for branch_id, runtime in coordinator.branches.items():
    if runtime.overlay is None:
        continue
    for change in runtime.overlay.changes():
        print(branch_id, change.op, change.path, change.timestamp)
```

## Limitations / non-goals

Stage 1 deliberately shipped the minimum kernel. The following are **not** supported until later stages:

- **Live per-token streaming inside branch panels** — Stage 3 renders each branch's final messages once its `asyncio.Task` completes; mid-run streaming inside the panel would require reworking the coordinator's task spawn. Status badges (`●`/`✓`/`✗`/`⊘`/`$`/`$$`) update live via a 0.5 s poller.
- **Autonomous merge** (judge model, confidence scoring, vote mode) — Stage 6.
- **Persistent fork state** — `InMemoryForkStateStore` is the only store across all stages; process restart loses fork state.
- **Auto-merge of branch outputs into a single Pydantic blob** — intentionally excluded everywhere; "pick a winner" is the model.

Stage 4 added per-branch + aggregate budget enforcement. The following stay out of scope:

- **Predictive termination** — branches are cancelled when the cap is *crossed*, not extrapolated.
- **Per-tool cost caps** within a branch.
- **Cost projection** before a branch is spawned.
- **Dynamic budget reallocation** mid-run.

!!! note "Aggregate budget enforcement is best-effort"
    Under concurrent cost callbacks the running sum can briefly exceed `aggregate_budget_usd` before every branch sees its cancel — the coordinator serialises termination dispatch under its own lock, but cost callbacks from sibling branches can race the watcher. Strict enforcement would require per-tool-call cost checks (out of scope).

Stage 2's `diff_branches` is purely textual — these are deferred or out of scope by design:

- **Semantic / AST-based diff** — pure text diff only.
- **Rename detection** — a branch that renames a file shows as delete+create.
- **Diff of tool-call sequences** — process diff is not tracked; only outcomes are diffed.

Stage 5 deliberately keeps external diff integration narrow — the following are **not** supported and tracked as follow-up issues:

- **Native IDE plugin** (file watcher, in-IDE accept/override buttons) — would require a JetBrains/VS Code plugin.
- **Bidirectional edits** — the user editing a branch file on disk does not flow back into the run; the on-disk tree is inspection-only.
- **Custom difftool integration beyond PyCharm / VS Code** — supported opaquely via the `PYDANTIC_DEEP_DIFFTOOL` env var; we do not ship per-tool adapters.
- **`git difftool` driver mode**.
- **Inline hunk-level accept/reject** (PyCharm plugin or TUI).
- **Real-time write-back during a fork** — branches own their overlays in isolation while running; cross-branch propagation only happens at merge.
- **File-aware checkpoint rewind across `post-fork:<id>`** — the merged conversation history is preserved by the checkpoint anchor but file writes are not.
