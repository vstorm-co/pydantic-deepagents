Done! I found and recovered your lost changes:

1. **Found the issue**: Your commit `650dba4` ("Move to Stanford") was made on a
detached HEAD state. When you checked out master, that commit became orphaned 
(not on any branch).

2. **Recovered the commit**: I merged the orphaned commit into master. There was
a merge conflict in `_includes/about.md` which I resolved by keeping your 
Stanford changes (the incoming change).

Your "Move to Stanford" changes are now on the master branch:
- `_includes/about.md` - Updated to "Postdoctoral Researcher at Stanford CS"
- `_layouts/default.html` - Modified as part of your changes
