⎿ 1:80|In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice 
that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.
  2:d4|
  3:62|``Whenever you feel like criticising any one,'' he told me, ``just 
remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that 
you've had.''
  4:d4|
  5:c6|He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in 
a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In 
consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up 
many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran 
bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality 
when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was 
unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs
of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought---frequently I have 
feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some 
unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for 
the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they 
express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. 
Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of 
missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I 
snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out 
unequally at birth.

⎿ 11:d4|I never saw this great-uncle, but I'm supposed to look like him---with 
special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father's 
office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my
father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration 
known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came 
back restless. Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West 
now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe---so I decided to go East and 
learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I 
supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it
over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, 
``Why---ye-es,'' with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me 
for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the
spring of twenty-two.
  12:d4|
  13:0f|The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm 
season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when 
a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting
town, it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weatherbeaten 
cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered 
him to Washington, and I went out to the country alone. I had a dog---at least I
had him for a few days until he ran away---and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman,
who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over
the electric stove.
  14:d4|
  15:5b|It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently 
arrived than I, stopped me on the road.

  7:db|And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission 
that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes,
but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on. When I came back 
from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at
a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more wild trips with privileged 
glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this 
book, was exempt from my reaction---Gatsby, who represented everything for which
I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful 
gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened 
sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those 
intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This 
awareness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is 
dignified under the name of the ``artistic mood''---it was an extraordinary gift
for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person 
and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No---Gatsby turned out all 
right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the 
wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive 
sorrows and short-winded elations of men.

  9:d6|My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western 
city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan, and we have a
tradition that we're descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual 
founder of my line was my grandfather's brother, who came here in fifty-one, 
sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware business 
that my father carries on to-day.
