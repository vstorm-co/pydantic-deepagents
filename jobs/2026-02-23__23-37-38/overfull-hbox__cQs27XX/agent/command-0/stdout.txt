⎿ 1:80|In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice 
that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.
  2:d4|
  3:62|``Whenever you feel like criticising any one,'' he told me, ``just 
remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that 
you've had.''
  4:d4|
  5:c6|He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in 
a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In 
consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up 
many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran 
bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality 
when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was 
unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs
of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought---frequently I have 
feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some 
unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for 
the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they 
express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. 
Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of 
missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I 
snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out 
unequally at birth.

⎿ 7:03|And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission 
that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes,
but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on. When I came back 
from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at
a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with 
privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his 
name to this book, was exempt from my reaction---Gatsby, who represented 
everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken 
series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some
heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of 
those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This
responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is 
dignified under the name of the ``creative temperament''---it was an 
extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in 
any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No---Gatsby
turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust 
floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the
abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.

season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when 
a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting
town, it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weatherbeaten 
cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered 
him to Washington, and I went out to the country alone. I had a dog---at least I
had him for a few days until he ran away---and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman,
who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over
the electric stove.

way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence,
I'm inclined to reserve all verdicts, a habit that has opened up many odd 
natures to me and also made me the prey of not a few veteran bores. The unusual

copied and marred by plain suppressions. Reserving verdicts is a matter of 
endless faith. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that,
