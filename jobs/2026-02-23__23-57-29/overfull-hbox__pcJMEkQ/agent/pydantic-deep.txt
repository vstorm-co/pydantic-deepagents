⎿ 1:80|In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice 
that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.
  2:d4|
  3:62|``Whenever you feel like criticising any one,'' he told me, ``just 
remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that 
you've had.''
  4:d4|
  5:c6|He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in 
a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In 
consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up 
many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran 
bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality 
when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was 
unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs
of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought---frequently I have 
feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some 
unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for 
the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they 
express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. 
Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of 
missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I 
snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out 
unequally at birth.

⎿ 5:60|He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually open in a quiet 
way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence,
I'm inclined to reserve all opinions, a habit that has opened up many odd 
natures to me and also made me the prey of not a few dated bores. The odd mind 
is fast to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal 
person, and so it came about that in school I was unjustly accused of being a 
politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most 
of the confidences were unwanted---frequently I have feigned sleep, 
preoccupation, or an adverse levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign 
that a close exposure was quivering on the horizon; for the close exposures of 
young men, or at least the words in which they express them, are usually copied 
and marred by clear censorings. Reserving opinions is a matter of endless faith.
I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father 
snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the basic manners is 
parcelled out unequally at birth.

  7:ab|And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission 
that it has a limit. Actions may be founded on the hard rock or the damp swamps,
but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on. When I came back 
from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at
a sort of moral focus always; I wanted no more wild trips with privileged 
glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his title to this 
text, was exempt from my reaction---Gatsby, who represented everything for which
I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful 
gestures, then there was something lovely about him, some enhanced sensitivity 
to the vows of life, as if he were related to one of those complex devices that 
register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This reaction had nothing to do 
with that soft influence which is dignified under the name of the ``artistic 
mood''---it was an amazing talent for faith, a dreamy alertness such as I have 
never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find 
again. No---Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby,
what dirty dust floated in the wake of his hopes that temporarily closed out my 
concern in the failed sorrows and short-winded joys of men.

  11:d4|I never saw this great-uncle, but I'm supposed to look like him---with 
special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father's 
office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my
father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration 
known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came 
back restless. Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West 
now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe---so I decided to go East and 
learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I 
supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it
over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, 
``Why---ye-es,'' with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me 
for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the
spring of twenty-two.
