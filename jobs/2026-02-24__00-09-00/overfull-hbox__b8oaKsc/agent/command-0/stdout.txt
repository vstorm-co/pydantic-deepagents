⎿ 1:80|In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice 
that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.
  2:d4|
  3:62|``Whenever you feel like criticising any one,'' he told me, ``just 
remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that 
you've had.''
  4:d4|
  5:c6|He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in 
a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In 
consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up 
many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran 
bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality 
when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was 
unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs
of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought---frequently I have 
feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some 
unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for 
the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they 
express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. 
Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of 
missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I 
snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out 
unequally at birth.
