⎿ 1:80|In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice 
that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.
  2:d4|
  3:62|``Whenever you feel like criticising any one,'' he told me, ``just 
remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that 
you've had.''
  4:d4|
  5:c6|He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in 
a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In 
consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up 
many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran 
bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality 
when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was 
unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs
of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought---frequently I have 
feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some 
unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for 
the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they 
express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. 
Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of 
missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I 
snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out 
unequally at birth.

⎿ 11:d4|I never saw this great-uncle, but I'm supposed to look like him---with 
special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father's 
office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my
father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration 
known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came 
back restless. Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West 
now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe---so I decided to go East and 
learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I 
supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it
over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, 
``Why---ye-es,'' with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me 
for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the
spring of twenty-two.
  12:d4|
  13:58|The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm 
season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when 
a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting
town, it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weatherbeaten 
cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered 
him to Washington, and I went out to the country alone. I had a dog---at least I
had him for a few days until he ran away---and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman,
who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over
the powered stove.
  14:d4|
  15:5b|It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently 
arrived than I, stopped me on the road.
